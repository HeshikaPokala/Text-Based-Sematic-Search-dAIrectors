1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,466
Yo, so, what's next?

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,968
We wait.

3
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,070
You don't got like
eight more anal things

4
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,572
we gotta do first?

5
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,574
The reaction has begun.

6
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,978
Yeah, I know. So how long?

7
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,980
Well, if we had a freezer,

8
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,433
the condensed liquid
would cool more quickly

9
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,769
because, of course, this
is an exothermic reaction

10
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,971
which means "giving off heat."

11
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,274
And our desired product is...

12
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,977
Put me into a
coma, why don't you?

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,230
What did you just say?

14
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:56,283
What? What? Nothing.

15
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:58,307
Huh.

16
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,444
No, no, no. Not in here.

17
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,996
Duh. Like I'm an idiot.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,139
Yeah. Like you're
an idiot. Dick.

19
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:29,015
God. Jesus. God.

20
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,340
Shut up. Oh, wow.

21
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:48,585
Bogdan. Bogdan says I'm
not doing the receipts right.

22
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,488
Well, he's got a
bug up his butt.

23
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,690
He's got a stick up his butt?

24
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:56,893
He's got a bug up his butt
about the receipts, anyways.

25
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,597
So anyway, he's
insisting that I...

26
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,067
He's demanding that I stay

27
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,503
and look over his system

28
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:09,294
and I cannot get out of it.

29
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,041
Yeah.

30
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,486
Hello.

31
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,589
Hey, you. What's going on?

32
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,626
I, uh, was just,

33
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,997
um, calling to say I'm sorry,

34
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,199
but I'm gonna be late tonight.

35
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,734
Bogdan. He's got
a bug up his butt.

36
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:42,822
That's okay. I wasn't planning
anything special for dinner, so.

37
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:47,326
In fact, you could take pity
on us and bring a pizza home.

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,096
They're having a
two-for-one at Venezia's.

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,399
At this point, I could eat
a whole one by myself.

40
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:56,135
Yeah, yeah, sure. I
can pick up a pizza, heh.

41
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,405
Hopefully Bogdan
won't keep me too late.

42
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,439
He better not. Trust me,

43
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:02,826
he does not want to piss off
a hungry, pregnant woman.

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,727
Ooh! What's that sound?

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,638
Yeah, and I got 9 bucks
more than I paid for it.

46
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,873
Shows what I know about art.

47
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:23,946
Do you like it?

48
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,765
I think I really like it.

49
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,402
Holly. Yeah, it's nice.

50
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,854
Let me think about it.

51
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,274
Just feels right, you
know? It's my new favorite.

52
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,942
Well, it's a
front-runner, for sure.

53
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,818
Listen, I was thinking, um,

54
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,488
maybe we can have a little
family time this weekend.

55
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,708
You know, just take a drive.

56
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,245
The almost four
of us. Heh-heh-heh.

57
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,519
Oh, my God. We haven't
been there in forever.

58
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,630
Holly. It's growing on me.

59
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:16,232
Yep. Me too.

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,070
All right, well, I had better
go and get this in the mail.

61
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,961
Ah. JACK: Whoa.

62
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,118
Simmer down there, sparky.

63
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,437
What the hell did
we just walk into?

64
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,107
Hey, Uncle Jack, I
don't see Jesse Pinkman.

65
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,109
He was right here before.

66
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,811
Anybody got eyes on Pinkman?

67
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:25,812
No.

68
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,013
What do you figure?

69
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,615
He may be headed
down that gully there?

70
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,234
That's the way I'd go.

71
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:34,370
Frankie, Lester, go find him.

72
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,206
Jack.

73
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,596
These guys are DEA.

74
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,251
No, Jack!

75
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,153
No, Jack! Jack! Jack!

76
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,122
No! No, don't!

77
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:54,490
Jack, don't. No.

78
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,083
No, Jack, Jack, Jack! Jack, no!

79
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,664
- Jack, no. Don't kill him.
- Uh-Uh, back it up.

80
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,866
Don't kill him,
Jack. Get back here.

81
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,501
The hell not? He's DEA.

82
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,959
No, ah, he's family.

83
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,157
Say again?

84
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,459
He's my family.

85
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,328
He's my brother-in-law.

86
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,563
Didn't cross your
mind to maybe tell us

87
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,304
you had a DEA agent
for a brother-in-law?

88
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,054
Did you know about this? I
called you off, remember?

89
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,539
I told you not to come.

90
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,641
Well, it seems to me
we did you a solid.

91
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:30,426
You weren't supposed to be here.

92
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,728
Too late now. How's
about you telling me

93
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,398
what was going
down out here? Hmm?

94
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,267
You and your
brother-in-law don't seem

95
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,169
to be getting along too well.

96
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,438
It doesn't matter. It
doesn't concern you.

97
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,408
We just wasted his partner
here and he's wearing a bullet,

98
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,661
so, yeah, I'd say it
does concern me.

99
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:51,448
This is between him and me.

100
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,784
No cavalry coming? No.

101
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,435
You bet your ass
the cavalry's coming.

102
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,870
No, no, no! Jack...

103
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:02,742
Jack! No, the DEA
doesn't know about this.

104
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,999
Not yet.

105
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:10,850
Hank.

106
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:15,304
Nothing can change
what just happened,

107
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,174
but you can walk
out of here alive

108
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:22,917
if you just promise us
that you'll let this go.

109
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,518
Heh, yeah, I thought as much.

110
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,120
Sorry, man. Just no
scenario where this guy lives.

111
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,106
No, no, no, listen!
I have money!

112
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,327
I have money! It's
buried out here. It's...

113
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,388
It's $80 million.

114
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,395
Eighty million.

115
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:59,048
So that's what got
this party started, huh?

116
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,151
But this money of yours won't
do me much good in prison.

117
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,886
You can go anywhere.

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,022
You can do anything.
Think about it.

119
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:09,447
You can have any
future that you want.

120
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,162
Jack.

121
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,616
Eighty million.

122
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,285
And all you've got to do

123
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,354
is let him go.

124
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,590
That's a hell of an offer.

125
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,959
What do you think, fed?

126
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,711
Would you take that deal?

127
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,480
It's Hank.

128
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,988
His name is Hank.

129
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,221
How about it, Hank?

130
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,745
Should I let you go?

131
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,632
My name is ASAC Schrader.

132
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:51,823
And you can go fuck yourself.

133
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,907
Hank, listen to me.

134
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,975
You gotta tell him...

135
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,244
You gotta tell him now
that we can work this out.

136
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,081
Please. Please.

137
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,956
What? You want me to beg?

138
00:10:11,228 --> 00:10:14,907
You're the smartest
guy I ever met.

139
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,298
And you're too stupid to see

140
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,886
he made up his
mind 10 minutes ago.

141
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,913
Do what you're gonna do...

142
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,516
Pretty specific directions.

143
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,384
Most people tell me
to be somewhere,

144
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,121
they say, "West on
the 40, this or that exit,

145
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,790
second gas station
on the left." You know?

146
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:24,494
This here? This is
a whole other story.

147
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,995
That fancy phone of yours,

148
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,579
where does it
say this is exactly?

149
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,108
Yeah.

150
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,604
Look at this. They
even brought a shovel.

151
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,630
Jack, no sign of Pinkman.

152
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,104
All right.

153
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,640
Says this is it right here.

154
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,130
Dig.

155
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,894
What's that? A
barrel? Couple barrels?

156
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,646
Jesus. MAN 2: Hell, yeah!

157
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,781
Oh, Jesus. Would
you look at that?

158
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:37,383
- Hell, yeah!
- Goddamn.

159
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,274
What are you waiting for?

160
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,178
Yeah, boss. Hell, yeah.
Let me get on this side.

161
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,587
Get that out of there, man.

162
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,894
Okay. Pull a
barrel off the truck

163
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,395
and load it in the Chrysler.

164
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,733
Seriously? Jack.

165
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:46,368
That's like 10 or 11
million right there.

166
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,720
You sure you wanna do that?

167
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,589
You gonna make me say it again?

168
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,874
Go, go. Chop, chop.

169
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,793
Jesus, what's with
all the greed here?

170
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:56,684
It's unattractive.

171
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:05,304
Hey. Hey.

172
00:14:05,328 --> 00:14:07,773
I'm leaving you a barrel.

173
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,709
Boys are gonna load it for you.

174
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,000
You got the keys to these cuffs?

175
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,097
I'm sorry for your loss.

176
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,749
My nephew here, he respects you.

177
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:40,322
He would never forgive me
if things went another way.

178
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,558
Also you caught
me in a good mood.

179
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:45,478
So here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get in your car,

180
00:14:45,502 --> 00:14:49,537
and you're gonna drive
out of here, all right?

181
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,185
No hard feelings.

182
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,875
Understand me?

183
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,375
We square?

184
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,410
Hey, man, I gotta
know we're square,

185
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,667
or we're gonna have
to go that other way.

186
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:19,934
Pinkman.

187
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,451
Pinkman.

188
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:27,608
You still owe me.

189
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,513
If you can find
him, we'll kill him.

190
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,834
Found him.

191
00:15:45,895 --> 00:15:47,461
No!

192
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,910
Get off me!

193
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:52,128
Get off!

194
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,721
No, no.

195
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,872
Good to go?

196
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,830
Hey, Uncle Jack.

197
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:34,052
Well, he was out
here with those feds.

198
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,521
Right? Working with them.

199
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:38,140
Should we maybe find
out what he told them first?

200
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,227
Because, I mean, he had
to have told them some stuff

201
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,571
that might not be
too good for us.

202
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:48,967
And I'll bet we could get
it out of him back home.

203
00:16:48,991 --> 00:16:50,271
I mean, I can do it.

204
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:56,330
Me and him, we got history.

205
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:02,002
And then, you know, we'd
take care of the job after that.

206
00:17:04,006 --> 00:17:06,057
Works for me. Work for you?

207
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,977
Let's go, pal. No. No!

208
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:20,104
No! No! WALT: Wait.

209
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,766
I watched Jane die.

210
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:45,379
I was there. And
I watched her die.

211
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,385
I watched her overdose
and choke to death.

212
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,590
I could have saved her.

213
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,193
But I didn't.

214
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,685
Hi. Hello.

215
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,955
That truck belong to you?

216
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,225
It does.

217
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:44,578
I'd like to buy it.

218
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,215
It's not for sale.

219
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,037
Hey, Walt, it's me.

220
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,505
Um, just thought
I'd try you again.

221
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,642
We were just wondering
when you thought you'd be back

222
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:25,480
so just give us a call
whenever you can.

223
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,715
Bye.

224
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,386
Hey, Aunt Marie.

225
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,388
Hey, sweetie.

226
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:36,157
Haven't seen you for a while.
What have you been up to?

227
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,594
Oh, you know. This and that.

228
00:23:38,618 --> 00:23:42,347
Your mom and I need to
talk, so thought I'd stop by.

229
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:45,583
Well, I, uh, wish
you'd called first.

230
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,237
This isn't the best time.

231
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,972
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

232
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,196
Why don't we go
into your office?

233
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,483
I got it.

234
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,807
Okay, honey. Thanks.

235
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,519
Marie, I have nothing
to say. Well, I do.

236
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:25,690
So you can just
sit there and listen.

237
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,159
I got a call from Hank.

238
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:30,845
He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

239
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,581
It's over.

240
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,584
"Dead to rights" I
believe is the expression.

241
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,919
Hank and Steve Gomez are working

242
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,489
with a former associate
of Walt's, Jesse Pinkman,

243
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,791
whom I know you know,

244
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,317
and Pinkman has supplied
them with everything they need.

245
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:51,583
Hank is booking
Walt as we speak.

246
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,257
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

247
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,944
I almost didn't come here.

248
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,914
Christ, I barely even
know who you are,

249
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:09,473
and I sure as hell don't know
if I can ever trust you again.

250
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,711
And then I think about how
you were so upset with Walt

251
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,814
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

252
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:25,250
and all of this makes me believe

253
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,652
that there has got
to be hope for you

254
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:31,245
that whatever he did
to you can be undone.

255
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:39,965
All I know, all I have been
forcing myself to remember

256
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:41,588
is that you are my sister.

257
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,309
And so I'm here.

258
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,926
Marie... Everything changes now.

259
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,197
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

260
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,733
Hank will help you as much
as he can. I know he will.

261
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:03,538
And I will support
you through this.

262
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,808
But I have conditions.

263
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,377
Give me every single
copy of that obscenity

264
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,514
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank. That DVD.

265
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:16,551
Every single copy.

266
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,154
You understand me?

267
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,123
Answer me. Do you understand me?

268
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:24,059
Yes.

269
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,749
Good.

270
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,599
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here.

271
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,200
You are going to
tell him everything,

272
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,902
and I mean everything.

273
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,504
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

274
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,657
Not a bunch of
uniformed strangers.

275
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,825
No. No. No, he cannot know.

276
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,162
You tell him, or I will.

277
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,798
There's no way around this.

278
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:50,590
He needs to know, and
he needs to know now.

279
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:25,203
No.

280
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:46,191
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

281
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,259
Come on, man, please.

282
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:49,827
Hey, please.

283
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,813
I told you where to
find the tape, okay?

284
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,814
Yup.

285
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,982
Hey, just go.

286
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,736
Just go there. Just go
to his house and get it.

287
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,606
We're on it. Get it!

288
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,376
No one else knows about
it. Just me and his partner.

289
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,435
Okay. No one else
knows, I swear!

290
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,199
Let's cook.

291
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,580
You're completely
out of your mind.

292
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,796
- It's the truth.
- It is, Flynn.

293
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,231
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

294
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:26,101
You're full of shit, is
what you are. Both of you.

295
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:30,272
If this is true, then how
could you keep this a secret?

296
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:34,731
I mean, why? Why
would you go along?

297
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,397
I'll be asking myself
that for the rest of my life.

298
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,501
So you're saying all this
time you were lying about this?

299
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:46,855
Uh, I mean, so you're
saying you're a liar.

300
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,023
You just admitted it.

301
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,828
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

302
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,395
Which lie is it?

303
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,265
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

304
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,235
Right here, right
now. Believe it.

305
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:01,402
You know what?

306
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,422
This is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

307
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,508
Baby... WALT JR.:
I wanna talk to Dad.

308
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,909
Your dad's in custody.

309
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:09,377
You can't talk to
him for a while.

310
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,711
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

311
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,580
I've tried. He's not answering.

312
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,333
He's probably in the
thick of it with your father.

313
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:18,469
Honey, I know this is
a lot to process, Flynn,

314
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,172
but if you could just
breathe, just try to breathe,

315
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,674
and just trust...
Really? Really?

316
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:24,408
Try to breathe?

317
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,446
Oh, my God.

318
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,968
Go home.

319
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,837
Just take the kids home,
okay? Go home and regroup.

320
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:39,029
I'll stop by later.

321
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:13,246
Flynn?

322
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:17,984
Could you put your
seatbelt on, please?

323
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,335
Please. It's not safe.

324
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,459
You're shitting me, right?

325
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,846
If all this is true and
you knew about it,

326
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,271
then you're as bad as him.

327
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,733
Whose truck is that?

328
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,353
Dad?

329
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,492
Listen, I need you to come
inside and pack right now.

330
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,729
Mom, Aunt Marie, they
said that you were arrested?

331
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:08,863
No, just...

332
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,381
You're some kind of drug dealer?

333
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,450
No, just come
inside, please. Now.

334
00:33:12,474 --> 00:33:13,802
Come inside. Come on.

335
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,837
Go, go, go.

336
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,872
Dad, stop. Just
talk to me, please.

337
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,774
Our priority right
now is to pack.

338
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,810
Uncle Hank, they
said he arrested you?

339
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,178
I will discuss all
of this later, okay?

340
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,798
Just tell me what...
Just listen to me!

341
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:29,967
Go into your bedroom
now, grab anything important.

342
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:33,070
You understand? Go.
Now. Both of you. Go.

343
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,227
Walt.

344
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,276
Why are you here?

345
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,912
Skyler, please, will you
just go get your things?

346
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,881
For you and the kids.
Now. This is our priority.

347
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:47,802
Hank had you in custody.
He wouldn't just let you go.

348
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:52,307
Where is he?
Where's Hank? I, uh...

349
00:33:52,331 --> 00:33:54,258
I negotiated... Negotiated?

350
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,350
Uh, yes. What does that mean?

351
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:02,800
It means we're fine, okay?

352
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:06,104
We are. We're fine.
Everything is gonna be fine,

353
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,705
but we need to leave right now.

354
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,141
- All right? Can we do that?
- What happened?

355
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:12,443
Where is Hank?

356
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,078
Why do we need to leave?

357
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:17,782
I need both of you to trust me.

358
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,951
Right now, okay?

359
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,236
Please, just work with me here,

360
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,107
and I promise I will explain
everything later, okay?

361
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:30,833
Where is Hank?

362
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,906
Skyler.

363
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:46,227
I have $11 million
in cash right outside.

364
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,363
We can have a fresh start.

365
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,850
Whole new lives.

366
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:56,054
All we have to do is go.

367
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:58,556
We have to go right now.

368
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,130
That's all we have to do.

369
00:35:04,219 --> 00:35:07,286
You killed him.

370
00:35:11,393 --> 00:35:13,421
You killed Hank.

371
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,156
What? No, no, no.

372
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,926
You killed him. No, no, no!

373
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,827
I tried to save him.

374
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,297
Uncle Hank is dead? I...

375
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,766
Mom, it can't be true.
It just can't be true.

376
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,136
Just stop, please.
Everything is gonna be okay.

377
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,204
Everything's gonna
be fine, I promise,

378
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,023
but we need to leave right now.

379
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:34,692
Dad, what's going
on? Talk to me.

380
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,294
Just stop for one second.

381
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,363
Look, I told you
to get your things.

382
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,866
Stop walking away.
- There is no time.

383
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,367
Tell me about Uncle Hank.

384
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,770
No, just drop it! WALT
JR.: What's wrong with you?

385
00:35:45,794 --> 00:35:47,639
We're going. We're
going right now.

386
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:50,107
You have to tell me. Dad, wait.

387
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:53,666
What happened to
Uncle Hank? What...?

388
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,217
Get out.

389
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,986
Skyler, I promise you,
we will figure this out.

390
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,774
Enough. Mom, what are you doing?

391
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,210
Skyler, put the
knife down, please.

392
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,045
I promise you, everything...

393
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:15,066
Don't say one more word.

394
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,903
Get out of here now.

395
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,772
Skyler...

396
00:36:20,796 --> 00:36:21,796
Get out!

397
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,998
Stop it! Just stop! Just stop!

398
00:36:31,473 --> 00:36:35,420
- Let go! Let go!
- Get away from us!

399
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,372
Just stop! Stop!

400
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:40,558
Dad, stop it! Stop!

401
00:36:40,582 --> 00:36:42,377
Mom, stop it.

402
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:45,213
Stop, Dad. Stop it now. Stop.

403
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:48,132
Stop! Just, please, stop!

404
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:52,103
Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

405
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,612
What the hell is wrong
with you? We're a family!

406
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,986
We're a family.

407
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:15,410
What are you doing?

408
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,078
What are you doing?

409
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,512
Yeah, I need the police.

410
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,199
My dad, he pulled
a knife on my mom.

411
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:23,968
He attacked her. He's dangerous.

412
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,271
I think he might
have killed somebody.

413
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:28,828
Yeah.

414
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,677
He's still here.

415
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,680
Yeah, he's still in the house.

416
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,900
We're at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

417
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:42,703
308 Negra Arroyo Lane!
You've gotta come quick.

418
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:47,841
Hurry, hurry. Oh, God, no, no!

419
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:49,943
Oh, my God. No.

420
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,363
Walt, no! Walt! WALT JR.: Mom!

421
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:54,198
Walt, please, no!

422
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,767
No! No! No!

423
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,787
Walt, no! Let her go!

424
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,623
You can't take her!

425
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:04,676
Let her go, please!
You can't take her!

426
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,961
Let her go! Walt!

427
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:10,465
Walt, please, no!

428
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,889
Walt, no! Walt, please!

429
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,970
Walt, no!

430
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,973
Walt, please, no!

431
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:22,060
Walt, please!

432
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,628
Please, stop! Walt!

433
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,611
Say, "Da-da."

434
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:43,164
Da-da. You say, "Da-da"?

435
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:47,218
There. Get rid of that
stinky old diaper, huh?

436
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,054
Don't be sad. Where's
your belly button?

437
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,689
Where's your belly button?

438
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:55,192
There. Now, don't
you feel better?

439
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:58,362
You're all nice and dry. Oh.

440
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,697
That feels good? Oh, I know.

441
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,366
You were so wet and so cranky,

442
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,235
but now you feel
better, don't you?

443
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:09,006
Next order of business is to
get you a brand-new car seat.

444
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,781
Won't that be nice, Holly?

445
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,281
Mama.

446
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:19,951
Mama.

447
00:39:19,975 --> 00:39:23,171
Mama.

448
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,094
Mama.

449
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:33,464
Mama.

450
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,804
Mama.

451
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,243
Mama.

452
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,368
Confirming the abduction.

453
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,171
Amber Alert. Holly White.

454
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,473
Female, 18 months.

455
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,608
Blond hair, blue eyes.

456
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:06,847
Was last seen wearing a pink
and white jacket, pink pants.

457
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,666
Abductor is the father.

458
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:14,272
He was in handcuffs.
Hank had him in handcuffs.

459
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:18,543
Bald head, goatee,
gold wire-framed glasses.

460
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,318
Are you expecting a call?

461
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:38,746
Start tracing the landline.
The number's 505-177-8987.

462
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,253
Need the location
of an incoming caller.

463
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,327
Walt, where's Holly?

464
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:01,502
No. No police.

465
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:04,860
Where are you? Where's Holly?

466
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,509
Walt!

467
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,223
I told you, Skyler.

468
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,025
I warned you for a solid year.

469
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,760
You cross me, there
will be consequences.

470
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,963
What part of that
didn't you understand?

471
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,032
You took my child.

472
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,636
You bring her back.

473
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,238
Maybe now you'll listen.

474
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:40,040
Maybe now you'll
use your damn head.

475
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,576
You know, you
never believed in me.

476
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,813
You were never grateful for
anything I did for this family.

477
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:12,340
Now you tell my son what I do

478
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:23,272
You stupid bitch.

479
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,473
I'm sorry.

480
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,977
You have no right

481
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:53,480
to discuss anything
about what I do.

482
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,917
What the hell do you
know about it, anyway?

483
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:06,015
You're right. You're right.

484
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,652
You mark my words, Skyler.

485
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,468
Toe the line,

486
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:17,660
or you will wind
up just like Hank.

487
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:21,631
Walt.

488
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,030
Tell me what happened.

489
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:29,417
Where is Hank?

490
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,685
Please.

491
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,692
We need to know.

492
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,929
You're never gonna
see Hank again.

493
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,704
You let that sink in.

494
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:29,760
I've still got
things left to do.

495
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,253
Hey.
