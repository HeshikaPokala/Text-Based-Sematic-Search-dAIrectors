1
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,633
Thank you.

2
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,200
Ready, guys?

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
- Sir!
- What is tomorrow's schedule?

4
00:02:19,466 --> 00:02:21,000
Meeting with the cloaks at 2:00 p.m.

5
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,200
- After lunch, right?
- Yeah, right.

6
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:25,133
We have a calibration call with the
Bronocks for the upcoming fashion week.

7
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,333
And we need templates also.

8
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,500
They will be ready.

9
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,100
- You will receive the email.
- Okay, sir.

10
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,100
Viraj! Did you deny shooting
for the Bravokis?

11
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
- Yes.
- Why? It's such a big company.

12
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,733
We will lose our goodwill if we refuse.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,533
- When is the shoot?
- Next month, 24th...

14
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,133
- First!
- Hallelujah!

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,566
Send Amul.
Tell them I recommended him.

16
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,666
Amul? Hey, wait!

17
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,533
- Amul won't do it.
- We'll be stuck in traffic.

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,366
- The company will not spare me!
- You may go. I'll walk.

19
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:45,666
- Okay?
- You need to do something about it.

20
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,300
Look, I have committed.

21
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,166
I will be screwed if you don't do this.

22
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,333
Then get screwed.

23
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,166
Hey!

24
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,200
Viraj!

25
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:16,266
Really?

26
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,400
Hi!

27
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:23,666
Hey...

28
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:09,166
Your favorite fish. Hog it.

29
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,133
Thank you.

30
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
What's up with the drawing on the plate?
Something must be wrong.

31
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,633
What happened to my darling Mahi?

32
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,766
There is a boy called Varun in my class.

33
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,333
- Pluto...
- Is this an age to think about boys?

34
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,100
Who is he?

35
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,200
I don't know which school he came from.

36
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,766
He has been topping the class
since the last two exams!

37
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,166
He beat me with one percent.

38
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,300
You misunderstood.

39
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:01,266
Mahi... it's okay.

40
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,033
It's not okay, Grandpa.

41
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,366
It's just one percent, dear.

42
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,266
One percent, Dad!

43
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,566
With one percent, I've lost my reputation!

44
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,366
How can you say that?

45
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,600
Mahi.

46
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,433
Remember one thing.

47
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:19,166
It isn't about the goal.
The journey should be amazing.

48
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,500
Not the result,
but the experience must be important.

49
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,466
Winning and losing is God's will.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,766
Is this something you would discuss
with a six-year-old girl?

51
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:38,100
Says the father who assumed his
six-year-old daughter had a boyfriend!

52
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,166
What's today's story?

53
00:05:43,466 --> 00:05:44,400
A brand new one.

54
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,766
Alright then, let's go!

55
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:51,433
- Once upon a time, there was a king.
- Wait.

56
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,666
Whom should I imagine as the king?

57
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,666
Who else? Me!

58
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,600
Okay. Continue.

59
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:02,566
And the king had
a beautiful daughter named Tara.

60
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,766
That's me! That's me!

61
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,566
Obviously.

62
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,500
{\an8}One day, the king, his minister,
and his commander...

63
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,733
{\an8}- Dad, one minute!
- I got it.

64
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,533
Grandpa is the minister.
Justin is the commander.

65
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,333
Okay. Continue.

66
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:21,666
So... they all went...

67
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:46,000
And that's how Tara found the wand
and saved the king and the kingdom.

68
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,066
That's it?

69
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,200
That's it.

70
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:50,666
So, there's no Mom in this story either?

71
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,533
No.

72
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,266
You always keep doing this!

73
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,733
Do stories exist without mothers?

74
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:02,733
Some do.

75
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,366
Then I want a story with Mom!

76
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,600
Otherwise, I won't take my tablets.

77
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,133
You always come up with excuses.

78
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,466
You have to tell me now.

79
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,766
Even my school friends
ask me about my mom.

80
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,033
Fine, I will.

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,500
But not now.

82
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,333
When?

83
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,266
When you beat Varun
and get the highest rank in class.

84
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Then, I'll tell you...

85
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,300
Mom's story.

86
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,166
Mother promise?

87
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,100
Promise.

88
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:46,700
Will you take the tablets now?

89
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,233
Dad, I want a ukulele for this birthday.

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,566
Sure.

91
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,300
I love you, Dad.

92
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,466
I love you, dear.

93
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:26,366
Good night.

94
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,033
Good night.

95
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,733
You're narrating stories
that don't have a mother.

96
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:57,400
One day, you'll have to
narrate a story without lies.

97
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,066
Will you be able to?

98
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,166
There is still time for that.

99
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
She has begun asking me
when you are not around.

100
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,266
What should I say?

101
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,666
Do you know what people around
have been discussing?

102
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:23,133
- We should...
- I don't care what people think.

103
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,500
I only care about my daughter.

104
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,600
She is at an age where she is
susceptible to believing anything.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,066
You can ignore it.
But you are answerable to...

106
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:32,233
What's the update on
the doctor's appointment?

107
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,266
I spoke to her.

108
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,166
She is an expert in 65 Roses.

109
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:43,366
As per Sweden's time, 9:30 p.m.,
which is 2:00 a.m.

110
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,300
You have a video appointment.

111
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,466
Don't stay up too late.

112
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,166
Good night, son.

113
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:32,733
Mahi.

114
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,033
Which one's better among these?

115
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,300
I like the green one.

116
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,366
- Dude!
- Dad?

117
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,300
You know you can't eat this, right?

118
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,100
Oh, forget the cake.
We will party with pasta.

119
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:33,566
What happened to her mother?

120
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,400
Who knows?

121
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:37,233
Rumor is that he left her!

122
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:41,166
God knows what the poor wife
must have gone through!

123
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,233
Miss Greeshma Desai, you are fired!

124
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,500
Seema, it's your last warning.

125
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,366
Justin, cancel the whole goddamn event!

126
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,333
Yes, you heard it right.

127
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not about the money.
It's about our reputation.

128
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,100
- Did Mahi take her medicine?
- Yes, sir. But she isn't sleeping.

129
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,400
Fine. You leave.

130
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:06,500
I said I'll talk to the client!

131
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,500
Sir?

132
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:08,766
Okay.

133
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,266
Just cancel the event.

134
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,733
Why haven't you slept yet?

135
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,033
Class first.

136
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,166
Not just one percent.
I beat Varun with two percent!

137
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,066
I knew you'd do it.

138
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,333
Congrats, Mahi baby!

139
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,333
Thank you, Dad!

140
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:52,300
Dad had a very long day.

141
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,466
I'll go and take a shower.

142
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,300
Come back quickly. I'm waiting.

143
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:57,366
Waiting? Why?

144
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,400
I got the first rank in my class.

145
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,233
Well, I congratulated you.

146
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,300
That's alright,
but what about Mom's story?

147
00:17:19,433 --> 00:17:20,500
I told you, Mahi.

148
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,500
Dad is exhausted.

149
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:24,733
I have a lot of work to do.

150
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,433
So, some other time.

151
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:28,666
But, Dad, you promised me.

152
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,633
I got the first rank too.

153
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I know, Mahi.

154
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:35,466
Please try to understand.

155
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,233
Dad had a really bad day at the office.

156
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,433
Some other time for sure.

157
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,233
But you promised me!

158
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,400
What promise?

159
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,766
Why don't you understand?

160
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,533
How many times I've told you,
not to come into this room?

161
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,333
Go!

162
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,066
Viraj!

163
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,066
Viraj, get up!

164
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:34,366
Viraj!

165
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,166
Viraj!

166
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,000
Viraj, Mahi is nowhere to be found.

167
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:43,100
I got a call from her school.
She's not there either!

168
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:50,600
Viraj, I've searched everywhere.
Pluto is also missing.

169
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm coming to the school now.

170
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,766
Please let me know
if she comes there.

171
00:19:24,566 --> 00:19:26,466
Stop, Pluto! Stop!

172
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,766
Stop! Stop, I say!

173
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:33,700
Somebody, please help!

174
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,200
Somebody, catch him, please!

175
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,333
Good dog. Good dog.
Down, boy.

176
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:48,600
Here you go.

177
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,266
- Water?
- No, thank you.

178
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,366
I don't drink outside water.

179
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:01,133
Only... only warm water.

180
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,266
Okay. Okay.

181
00:20:23,366 --> 00:20:25,466
I've got a condition called 65 Roses.

182
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,300
Everyone says it is extremely fatal.

183
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,733
But, Dad says that it is all a sham
and nothing will happen to me.

184
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:41,366
Normally, I'm not supposed...

185
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,366
to jump or run...

186
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,033
or even eat that cotton candy.

187
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:54,000
But whenever I'm angry
with my Dad, I tend to eat it.

188
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,333
Thank you for your help. Bye.

189
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,600
- Bye.
- Come, Pluto.

190
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,033
Come.

191
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,300
Come, Pluto.

192
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,700
Pluto, come.

193
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,133
Pluto! Pluto!

194
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,166
Pluto, come!

195
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,400
- Yeah, okay.
- She's nowhere to be seen.

196
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,033
- You better go to the police station.
- Hello?

197
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:31,566
Mahi, are you crazy?

198
00:21:33,433 --> 00:21:34,633
You got away without telling anyone!

199
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,100
Do you know how worried I was?

200
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,400
Do you think this is a game?

201
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,566
My dad.

202
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,466
You didn't think twice, did you?

203
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,233
Hi, Dad. This is Yashna.

204
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:55,366
Viraj.

205
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:56,666
Viraj.

206
00:21:57,633 --> 00:21:59,266
Did you know what just happened?

207
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,466
Pluto! Pluto, come!

208
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:05,766
Pluto!

209
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,300
The speed at which that truck approached
us, I thought this was our last day!

210
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,500
- In a fraction of a second, everything...
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

211
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:19,066
Not me.

212
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:20,766
You should thank that truck driver.

213
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,266
What is this, Mahi?
Why did you come here?

214
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,166
To eat cotton candy.

215
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:33,133
Cotton?

216
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:35,366
Cotton candy!

217
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,300
You know you aren't supposed
to eat cotton candy.

218
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,366
Don't you know you aren't supposed
to break your promise?

219
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,166
She studied extremely hard,
day and night, for one month

220
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:54,400
and got the first rank in class
by scoring two percent more than Varun

221
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:55,733
to listen to her mom's story.

222
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And what did you do?

223
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,366
If you can break your promises,
can't she eat cotton candy?

224
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:07,766
- Ma'am...
- Yashna.

225
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,066
Miss Yashna.

226
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,566
I'm really grateful for your help.

227
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,766
But I need to speak to my daughter
in private.

228
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:17,500
Yeah, please. Go ahead.

229
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:20,733
Did you tell her everything?

230
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:25,533
What now?

231
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:27,400
Your mom...

232
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:30,133
You want your mom's story, right?

233
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,300
I'll tell you everything
in the evening. Promise.

234
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,766
A "mother promise" didn't work!

235
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,400
What can a normal promise do?

236
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:45,000
After you reach home, what's the guarantee

237
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
that you won't come up
with some lame excuses?

238
00:23:47,633 --> 00:23:49,400
We don't trust you.

239
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,133
Okay, what's your problem?

240
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,333
I will tell her whenever I want to.

241
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:01,733
Who are you?

242
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:02,733
Look, Viraj...

243
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,266
I was there today to save her.

244
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,000
I won't be there every day.

245
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:10,400
I promised Mahi that I would have you
tell her the story.

246
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't break my promise... unlike you.

247
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:17,433
Anyway, I'm done with my shopping.

248
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:20,566
I'm free till the evening
and I have my coffee with me.

249
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,600
And we are all ears!

250
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:37,700
Mahi, we don't even know who she is.

251
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,600
She is Yashna, my friend.

252
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:51,333
Don't I have a choice?

253
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,333
One cappuccino.

254
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,266
Once upon a time, there was a town...

255
00:25:12,633 --> 00:25:13,566
where I lived.

256
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:18,500
Come on, hurry!

257
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,266
Are you done?

258
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:45,633
There was a marvel in front of me.

259
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,433
A wonder!

260
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:52,633
The rain was the witness.

261
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,333
Dad, wait!

262
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:17,066
- What happened?
- Whom should I Imagine?

263
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,700
Who should I imagine as Mom?

264
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,166
Mahi, look at me.

265
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,466
Imagine me.

266
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:41,166
Dad, continue!

267
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,500
What are you doing?

268
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:04,700
Are you in love?

269
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:06,466
Cam... camera.

270
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:08,300
- I'm talking to you.
- Sister, what happened?

271
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,566
Aren't you ashamed to click pictures
of a girl you just saw?

272
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,300
What happened, madam?
What's the problem?

273
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,200
This man...

274
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,033
This man has been following me

275
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,033
and taking my photographs
without my permission.

276
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:23,400
Sister, let's file a police complaint.

277
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,733
- Hi.
- What's it, brother?

278
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,333
Are you crazy?

279
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:29,666
What?

280
00:29:30,366 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't get smart with me.

281
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:37,066
He is behaving like a goon.

282
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,366
- Camera.
- Idiot!

283
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,433
Hello, excuse me!

284
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,533
Why did you scold my friend?

285
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,533
Be glad that I didn't kill him.

286
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,033
Doesn't he have any shame?

287
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,400
- He is clicking pictures of strange women!
- Hey!

288
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,233
- Sister, let's file a police complaint.
- Police!

289
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,100
He is a passionate photographer.

290
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,666
Have you heard about Manish Lakhia?

291
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,033
He is a renowned photographer in Mumbai.

292
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:08,533
He is making a portfolio
to work under him.

293
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,533
Look at the pictures in the camera.

294
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,200
You won't find a single vulgar picture.

295
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,333
Please!

296
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,233
He was clicking your pictures for his job,
not because he's in love with you.

297
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:22,733
Hey, Pomeranian!

298
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:26,366
If you touch him again,
I'll file a police complaint.

299
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,633
- Hi...
- Viraj.

300
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,733
Viraj, I was not aware of all this.

301
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,133
I'm new to this town.

302
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,566
We are not even friends.

303
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,566
What else would I think if you
trailed me to take my pictures?

304
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,633
- I'm really sorry. I...
- I love you.

305
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,033
What are you doing?! Don't humiliate her!
Say sorry. Apologize!

306
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,500
It's love at first sight.

307
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,233
Sister, I'm really sorry.

308
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,400
I don't know who this man is.

309
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:15,133
You can file a complaint if you want to.

310
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,066
I'm really sorry.

311
00:31:18,033 --> 00:31:21,400
My photography mentor
always used to say one thing.

312
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,766
Every photo we capture must tell a story.

313
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,700
I didn't understand the meaning
until I met you.

314
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,400
Do you understand?

315
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,200
The first time I clicked your picture,

316
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,066
I found a story.

317
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:36,266
My story.

318
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,666
Our story.

319
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,500
How I met you?

320
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:42,033
How I fell in love with you?
How did we end up marrying?

321
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,466
The story I'm going to tell
our kids and their kids.

322
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
Hey...

323
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,066
Dude, my camera!

324
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:02,333
It's with my wife.

325
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,766
To hell with you!

326
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:05,033
Madam!

327
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,133
- 35 mm.
- What's that?

328
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,500
He will use those lenses.

329
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,266
If I don't get back the camera
that girl took,

330
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,700
I will use this rod to finish you off.

331
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,533
Give me a 35 mm lens.

332
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:22,000
What can I do now?
I can't find her anywhere.

333
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,433
A prime lens is a lens
that has a fixed focal length.

334
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:28,300
- Prime lenses are typically...
- She has come to the studio.

335
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:30,300
And they offer
a more narrow field of view.

336
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,366
- And...
- Hi, Uncle.

337
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,266
Hey, Varsha!
What a pleasant surprise!

338
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
How come she's here?

339
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,500
Yes.

340
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:41,300
I just wanted to come and say hi to you
and take some printouts.

341
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,433
Seriously? Are you laughing?

342
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:49,200
We are done for.

343
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,633
I will go and join my uncle's tea estate.
You join Gopi's Xerox shop.

344
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
You. Come here.

345
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,033
- Me?
- You! Come.

346
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,133
He's calling you.

347
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,700
You and I are not related.
Now get going.

348
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,700
Go on.

349
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:03,700
- He is coming, sir.
- Sir...

350
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:05,100
That's him, sir.

351
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,266
Viraj.

352
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:07,733
She needs a few printouts.

353
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:09,400
Don't worry, Varsha.

354
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:11,666
- Go with him. He'll help you out.
- Thank you, Uncle.

355
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,066
See you.

356
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:18,133
So, students, prime lenses are often used...

357
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,100
- Hey!
- This way.

358
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,133
What's going on? Tell me!

359
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
Hey! Dude!

360
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:25,666
This way.

361
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:34,466
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that our boss was your uncle.

362
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:36,766
If you knew, wouldn't you have
said those things to me?

363
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,566
You're lying, right?

364
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,000
Take the printouts.

365
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,200
I don't believe in love at first sight.

366
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,000
Like you.

367
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,133
Not just love at first sight.

368
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:08,100
In fact, I don't believe in love,
marriage, or even kids.

369
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,766
May I know why?

370
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:34,766
Varsha!

371
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,266
I want you and your brother
to pack your bags.

372
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,133
You're going to Coonoor
to stay with Uncle Mahendar.

373
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:54,466
Prints?

374
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,366
My parents are getting divorced.

375
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:09,066
Probably because
they thought we had

376
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,066
enough love or because
we were grown up.

377
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:13,633
I don't know.

378
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,133
They were together
for us all these years,

379
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,200
and now parting
ways for themselves.

380
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,700
This is my story.

381
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:28,333
Not as beautiful as you assumed.

382
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
These are wonderful pictures.

383
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,466
If you think they can help your career...

384
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:39,666
go ahead.

385
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:43,733
All the best.

386
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:51,733
You've given me permission
to use the pictures.

387
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,666
But we're not even friends, right?

388
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:59,366
I mean... do you mind?

389
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:02,766
I will be here for two weeks.

390
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,566
If you can give a pause
to your love story,

391
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:07,133
we could be friends.

392
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,733
Yes!

393
00:37:04,533 --> 00:37:06,233
- How's it? Good food?
- Amazing food!

394
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,300
Yeah.

395
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,200
Really nice. It's not at all spicy.

396
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,400
Have you...

397
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:13,533
You alright?

398
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,333
No, Uncle, just try this.

399
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,233
It's so good. Delicious!

400
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,600
Just try it.

401
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:30,733
It's good, right?

402
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,500
Excuse me. I need to use the washroom.
I'll join you.

403
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,100
Come.

404
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,000
What are you doing here?

405
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,366
Did you get it?

406
00:38:04,266 --> 00:38:06,633
- Open it. Open it!
- Wait.

407
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,166
Performing the same song on a grand stage
will drive the audience wild!

408
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:17,533
Not really.

409
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:20,166
I wrote this song during my childhood.

410
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,733
My mom doesn't like all this.

411
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
Please sing for me once.

412
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,233
If I sing again, I will fall in love.

413
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:34,766
With the song!

414
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,500
Leave me!
I said leave me!

415
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,500
Let go of me!
Just leave me!

416
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:46,633
What the hell?

417
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:55,400
Damn it! You're always
making a scene in public!

418
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,066
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Don't you care about our reputation?

419
00:39:58,333 --> 00:39:59,500
What the hell did I do?!

420
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,000
I saw you flirting with that freaking...

421
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,533
Do you care about that?

422
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,733
She's just a friend of mine, damn it!

423
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:51,700
Are you okay?

424
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:55,533
You always lie!

425
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:00,000
Who's there?

426
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,100
Stay here.
I'll see you tomorrow.

427
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:15,533
Hey!

428
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:18,466
- Come on, I'm right here!
- Get him!

429
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,566
- Catch me if you can!
- Come on!

430
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,433
I need to tell you something, Viraj.

431
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,466
Me too. Look at this new camera.

432
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,566
Canon 550D. 45,000 rupees.
I finally bought it.

433
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:13,100
Check the image quality, madam.
18 megapixels.

434
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:14,366
Single-lens reflex.

435
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:16,600
I can also click pictures of the stars
with this camera.

436
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,633
All of this is due to Pluto's blessings.

437
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:22,433
What does that mean?

438
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:26,233
It means a rich family has taken him.

439
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,400
Did you sell him?

440
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:32,766
No, I didn't sell him.
They only paid me.

441
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:37,300
Besides, I can't afford him
in this position.

442
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,033
Now, he has a big house,
and people to take care of him.

443
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:41,233
He will be very happy.

444
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:50,533
Big house, people, cars, money.

445
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,466
Maybe he doesn't want all of that.

446
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,200
Do you know how rich I am?

447
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,333
Let's say...

448
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,333
I loved you and came with you.

449
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:06,266
Will you abandon me as well

450
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,066
just because you can't look after me?

451
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:14,000
How are these things related?

452
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,700
Responsibility.

453
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,333
All you have is love...

454
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:23,100
and no sense of responsibility.

455
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,266
Why are you taking it personally?

456
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,666
You didn't even like him.

457
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:31,700
I thought the same until I came here.

458
00:44:37,366 --> 00:44:38,666
Why are you just walking away?

459
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,400
It means I'm leaving...

460
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:43,700
and I won't return.

461
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:03,700
Why did you come?

462
00:46:04,266 --> 00:46:06,533
Why did you come to Coonoor?

463
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,466
Because of my ill fate.
I didn't know you'd be there.

464
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,266
But I came here knowing
that you'd be here.

465
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,300
Why did it take so long?

466
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,633
Well, that's because of Pluto.

467
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,333
I would've come earlier
if I knew you'd hug me like this.

468
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:27,566
Will you go if I let you?

469
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:39,233
Is this friendship?

470
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:45,300
So... is this love?

471
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,666
No, this is called love!

472
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:46,633
Sir.

473
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,300
Thank you.

474
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:51,566
Get the cheque.

475
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:00,066
Viraj.

476
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,733
What do you do?

477
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,400
I'm... I'm a photographer.

478
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,066
How much do you earn?

479
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,433
How much do they pay
you monthly for the photos?

480
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:21,533
What?

481
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,300
Don't you have an answer?

482
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:30,466
Never mind.

483
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:33,166
Where do you stay?

484
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:35,166
Nearby. Thane.

485
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,700
We live in Malabar Hill.

486
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:43,033
How far is Thane from Malabar Hill?

487
00:48:44,033 --> 00:48:47,166
Roughly 35 to 40 kilometers, I assume.

488
00:48:49,666 --> 00:48:53,100
- From Coonoor to our house?
- Mom!

489
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,033
No. He should know
the distance between us, right?

490
00:48:59,433 --> 00:49:01,333
- Ma'am, cheque.
- Give it to him.

491
00:49:01,533 --> 00:49:02,766
- Okay, ma'am.
- Mom, this is too much.

492
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,133
- You invited him. So, you should pay.
- Sir.

493
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,233
Can't he even afford the food we ate?

494
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:13,266
I can't believe
you chose a guy like this!

495
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:19,433
I will go and check on Pluto.

496
00:49:20,033 --> 00:49:21,333
Please give me five minutes.

497
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,266
Thank you, Viraj.

498
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,633
What are you trying to prove?

499
00:49:35,266 --> 00:49:38,300
He is after your money!

500
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,366
Do you consider love and marriage
to be a joke?

501
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:45,666
Do you understand the factors
to analyze before marriage?

502
00:49:47,033 --> 00:49:50,600
You need to consider his background
and financial status.

503
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:53,700
You considered everything
and got married to Dad, right?

504
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,400
Did that stop you from getting a divorce?

505
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:03,466
My failed marriage doesn't become a reason

506
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,500
for you to love someone random.

507
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:10,300
I'm at least crying in a bungalow.

508
00:50:11,233 --> 00:50:14,700
You will grieve on the roads
if you marry him.

509
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:28,033
What?

510
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,233
He must've left long ago.

511
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:34,133
Pay the bill.

512
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:35,733
Let's go home.

513
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,633
Sorry.

514
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:52,033
Viraj.

515
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,733
- People tip 200 rupees in the hotel.
- Thank you, sir.

516
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,700
Thank you.

517
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,533
This is a tip.
I've paid the bill already.

518
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,200
Don't mistake me for a rich guy.

519
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:13,000
I was skeptical about paying the bill.

520
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,433
It was my monthly salary.

521
00:51:15,366 --> 00:51:17,433
Luckily, I got it yesterday.

522
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:23,300
I paid it out of sheer luck today.

523
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,233
But five years later,
it will be because of my hard work.

524
00:51:33,566 --> 00:51:38,100
Ma'am, it's 1200 kilometers
from Coonoor to here.

525
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:44,133
It took a couple of trains, one bus,
and three auto-rickshaws to reach here.

526
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:47,700
In the future, it might take just an hour.

527
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:53,200
I paid the bill today
with my entire month's salary.

528
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,666
But after I set up my own studio,
I might earn this amount in an hour.

529
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:08,233
You are measuring
our distance in kilometers.

530
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,133
I measure it with time.

531
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,500
Your distance will never change.

532
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,433
But my time certainly will.

533
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:27,033
Varsha, every single word
of your mom is true.

534
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,600
I really am a poor guy.

535
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,633
All I have is a two-acre farm
from my father.

536
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:43,300
If you come with me,

537
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:46,433
I'm clueless about taking care of you.

538
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:52,266
But...

539
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:55,533
if you are with me...

540
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:59,333
I feel like I can manage anything.

541
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,066
In fact...

542
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:08,433
I will win over the world.

543
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:13,533
Varsha...

544
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,133
will you marry me?

545
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,733
Pluto, you and I.

546
00:53:26,733 --> 00:53:27,633
That's enough!

547
00:53:33,433 --> 00:53:35,666
Thank you, guys.
Thank you so much.

548
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,566
Well, this song is dedicated
to my husband.

549
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:44,000
It's my third anniversary.

550
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:45,366
Congratulations!

551
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,666
Thank you, but he is late as usual.

552
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,133
This song, I wrote
in my mother tongue Malayalam.

553
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,333
And... I hope you guys like it.

554
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:56,500
Ready?

555
00:53:58,766 --> 00:53:59,766
Here we go.

556
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,166
Justin.

557
00:56:05,566 --> 00:56:06,466
Tell me.

558
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:14,066
What happened?

559
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:12,733
What are you thinking?

560
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,033
If we have children,

561
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:17,633
will they get your nose or mine?

562
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,633
What?

563
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,700
What happened?

564
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,033
I thought I was clear
about the kids, Viraj.

565
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:47,733
What did you say
when you asked me to marry you?

566
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,133
It'd be just you and me.
We don't need anyone else.

567
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:52,466
Didn't you say that?

568
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,600
Yes, I did.

569
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,066
- So, why are you saying this now?
- Kids are not outsiders.

570
00:58:57,766 --> 00:58:58,733
They are our extension.

571
00:58:59,566 --> 00:59:01,333
Wow! Good one!

572
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,166
Do you know how
much I love you, Viraj?

573
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:07,433
I was ready to go through

574
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,133
what my mom went
through in her marriage.

575
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:13,600
But I'm not ready...

576
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:18,400
to let my children suffer
like I have suffered as a child.

577
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,000
What are you trying to say?

578
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,333
That we won't stick together?

579
00:59:22,566 --> 00:59:23,633
Who's to say?

580
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:26,100
It has just been three years
since we got married.

581
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:28,233
Can you promise me that

582
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,300
we will always be happy?

583
00:59:32,666 --> 00:59:34,533
You are scared to make a promise.

584
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,366
I'm not scared to make a promise.

585
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,766
I'm scared of your thought process.

586
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,066
No one lives without
disagreements and conflicts.

587
00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:45,400
While I'm anticipating a beautiful future...

588
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,533
you are anticipating troubles?

589
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:50,733
Do you know
what you are talking about?

590
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:53,133
I'm not saying we will have trouble.

591
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,066
Our kids will have them because of us.

592
00:59:56,366 --> 01:00:01,166
If something goes wrong in the beautiful
future you are foreseeing...

593
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:05,400
our kids will suffer, not us.

594
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,433
You've gone crazy.

595
01:00:13,366 --> 01:00:14,333
You're mad.

596
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,733
You... Forget it!

597
01:00:18,233 --> 01:00:20,166
Talking to you was my mistake.

598
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,366
I made a mistake leaving the studio.

599
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,100
I should have stayed there.

600
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,766
Who is stopping you?
Go wherever you want to!

601
01:00:27,433 --> 01:00:30,000
Why did you come
if you were so bothered?

602
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,300
Right!

603
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:33,600
Because I was a fool.

604
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:35,300
Do whatever you want.

605
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,066
Marrying you was a mistake!

606
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:04,566
Sorry.

607
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,233
I'm sorry.

608
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:09,033
Sorry.

609
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,533
- Was marrying me a mistake?
- Sorry.

610
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,700
Sorry.

611
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,266
Fine... we'll do as you say.

612
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:24,533
It's up to you.

613
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:25,566
Even if you want to...

614
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:27,266
No, there's no need.

615
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,566
Let's see whose nose the kid will get.

616
01:01:35,466 --> 01:01:37,166
I never believed in love, Viraj.

617
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:39,733
But you proved me wrong.

618
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,533
I never believed in marriage either.

619
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,666
But look where you have brought me.

620
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:54,466
I thought of not having kids.

621
01:01:57,333 --> 01:02:01,166
But I know you will prove me
wrong once again.

622
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,633
But I'm scared Viraj!

623
01:02:05,733 --> 01:02:07,066
Hey, trust me.

624
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:10,666
This will be the best
decision of our life.

625
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,033
Be it a boy or a girl,
this kid will bring us lots of joy!

626
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,133
Promise?

627
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,700
Promise, promise, promise.

628
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,033
Then let's get pregnant.

629
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:33,200
Do you call this love?

630
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,000
This is called love.

631
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,100
And?

632
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:58,633
And...

633
01:03:00,233 --> 01:03:02,100
my world calls me Dad.

634
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,366
What about me?

635
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,700
What happened to me?

636
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,200
Her!

637
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:11,033
Yeah, sorry.

638
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,000
Her.

639
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:14,366
What happened to her?

640
01:03:21,533 --> 01:03:22,466
Singing.

641
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,033
She was always very passionate
about singing.

642
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,600
And she left chasing her passion.

643
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:29,666
Wait.

644
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:31,600
This doesn't make any sense.

645
01:03:32,366 --> 01:03:34,466
A girl who despised love and marriage

646
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,133
left everyone for you.

647
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:41,166
And when Mahi was born,
did she choose her career?

648
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,666
I don't believe it.

649
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,533
It isn't folklore for you
to believe it or not.

650
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,333
It's a true story.

651
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,466
Even then, it doesn't add up.

652
01:03:51,066 --> 01:03:52,233
You're hiding something.

653
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:53,633
Tell me the truth.

654
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:01,633
Mahi, you asked for Mom's story.

655
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,700
I told you.

656
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:04,566
We are done. Let's leave.

657
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:05,666
Pluto.

658
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,133
I got it.

659
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,433
There was a time when you
struggled to pay the bill.

660
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:21,600
Now you have the means to spend
2000 rupees on a single coffee.

661
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:27,366
So, your priorities may have
changed due to your status shift.

662
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,033
Mahi, let's go.

663
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,400
Pluto!

664
01:04:34,066 --> 01:04:37,700
You must have left her
like you left the story.

665
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:40,366
Mahi!

666
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:46,466
Dad, did you leave Mom?

667
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:09,666
You heard Mom's story.

668
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:12,200
Should I tell you Dad's?

669
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:15,633
Hi.

670
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,266
It's a baby girl.

671
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,066
Viraj!

672
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,266
Dr. Ranjan.

673
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:39,133
The baby has a condition
called Cystic Fibrosis.

674
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:40,666
It is a fatal condition.

675
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,766
She may not live long.

676
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,000
She was put in an incubator.

677
01:07:08,466 --> 01:07:09,366
You are here.

678
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,333
Look at our baby.

679
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:21,433
I can't figure out
if she got your nose or mine.

680
01:07:24,633 --> 01:07:26,400
They say it's a lung disease.

681
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,633
She won't live very long.

682
01:07:30,766 --> 01:07:32,433
Even if I try to feed her,

683
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:34,766
they say her heart might stop beating.

684
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:39,200
They're not letting me touch her, Viraj!

685
01:07:41,366 --> 01:07:43,233
You promised me, right?

686
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,000
This would be the
best decision of our life!

687
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,766
You said this kid would bring us joy.

688
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,600
I had refused already.

689
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,400
Why did this happen?

690
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,500
Mahi, wake up.

691
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,700
Mahi, wake up.

692
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:08,133
Please.

693
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,266
Hey.

694
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,633
I'll stay here. You go home.

695
01:09:39,433 --> 01:09:40,333
It's okay.

696
01:09:41,633 --> 01:09:44,033
I'm not saying it for you.
I'm saying it for her.

697
01:09:50,366 --> 01:09:52,733
She hasn't moved since yesterday.

698
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,066
She won't talk to anyone.

699
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:57,066
She will return to normalcy
only if you talk her through it.

700
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:04,500
It's been four months since
you spoke to me properly.

701
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:08,700
Trust me...

702
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:11,500
nothing will happen to her.

703
01:10:13,633 --> 01:10:14,733
I'm with you, Varsha.

704
01:10:19,366 --> 01:10:21,066
Talk to me, Varsha. Please.

705
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,100
I wish I hadn't come to Coonoor.

706
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:32,300
I wish I hadn't met you.

707
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:37,533
I wish I hadn't fallen in love with you.

708
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:43,100
I wish I hadn't married you.

709
01:10:45,633 --> 01:10:50,566
When you asked for kids,
I wish I hadn't agreed with you.

710
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:57,266
I wish Mahi hadn't been born to me!

711
01:11:01,366 --> 01:11:02,600
Don't say anything further.

712
01:11:03,566 --> 01:11:05,266
Let's go home, Dad.

713
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:27,700
Mahi!

714
01:11:28,466 --> 01:11:29,400
Mahi!

715
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:30,766
Mahi, please look at me.

716
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,700
- Mahi, please...
- One minute.

717
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:47,200
Viraj, what did I do?

718
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,766
Why isn't she talking to me?

719
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:55,500
She imagined you as her mother.

720
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,700
So...

721
01:11:57,133 --> 01:11:58,066
So...

722
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,266
she is upset with me
because I disowned her.

723
01:12:03,766 --> 01:12:04,766
But...

724
01:12:05,366 --> 01:12:07,500
tell her I'm not the real mother.

725
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:11,000
Don't worry.
She will be fine by tomorrow.

726
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,000
Can you please call me
once she is alright?

727
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:14,400
She has my number.

728
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,300
Viraj...

729
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,600
I don't know if I can ask you this.

730
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,166
But if you don't mind...

731
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,433
may I know what happened later?

732
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:09,233
I'm...

733
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:11,500
I'm really sorry.

734
01:14:12,633 --> 01:14:14,533
I wasn't aware of all of this...

735
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:16,500
It's okay. What can you do?

736
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,066
Some stories are like that.

737
01:14:19,533 --> 01:14:21,433
I'm actually really sorry.

738
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,233
Please don't cry.

739
01:14:24,166 --> 01:14:25,200
It's been years.

740
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:26,500
We moved on.

741
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:27,700
Don't worry.

742
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:34,166
Pluto, get in.

743
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:36,600
Pluto, get in!

744
01:15:01,066 --> 01:15:02,533
Surprise!

745
01:15:34,133 --> 01:15:35,033
What happened?

746
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:36,700
Nothing. I'm fine.

747
01:15:39,566 --> 01:15:40,600
How's Mahi?

748
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:42,233
She's asleep.

749
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:43,466
Okay.

750
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:33,433
Yashna!

751
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:35,300
Yashna!

752
01:16:38,766 --> 01:16:41,633
Everyone's asking for the bride.

753
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,566
What are you doing?

754
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,500
Nothing, Mom.
I'll be right there.

755
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,400
You can't see her!

756
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:57,666
I've every right.

757
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,500
- She is my wife.
- No, she is not.

758
01:17:00,033 --> 01:17:02,066
She doesn't even remember you, Viraj.

759
01:17:06,033 --> 01:17:11,266
She doesn't remember that
she is married and has a child.

760
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,633
In fact, she doesn't remember
that we are divorced.

761
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,100
She has forgotten everything.

762
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,200
We do not have control over
recovering lost memories.

763
01:17:47,233 --> 01:17:48,133
Why did you do this?

764
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,566
Somebody, please help!

765
01:18:53,666 --> 01:18:55,366
She wanted a divorce.

766
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,366
She spoke about it two days ago.

767
01:19:00,266 --> 01:19:01,400
Meanwhile...

768
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:11,733
I don't know which God she prayed to.

769
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:15,400
But she prayed for it firmly.

770
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:22,166
I wanted to see her without tears.

771
01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:26,266
But that didn't happen.

772
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,600
We'll never come into her life again.

773
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:41,200
Hi, Dad.

774
01:20:42,633 --> 01:20:44,000
This is Yashna.

775
01:21:31,133 --> 01:21:32,133
What's going on here?

776
01:21:32,366 --> 01:21:34,333
Does anyone in this house
intend to speak?

777
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,233
Are we playing dumb charades?

778
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:41,200
Hindi, English, Malayalam?

779
01:21:41,733 --> 01:21:43,033
Say something.

780
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:47,200
God, no one in this house
wants to talk to me!

781
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,500
That was quick!

782
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:53,533
You continue with your cold war.

783
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:57,700
Whether it's the paperboy or
the milkman, I will befriend them.

784
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,166
You just keep watching.

785
01:21:59,466 --> 01:22:00,400
Yeah!

786
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:08,333
Hallelujah.

787
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,200
Justin?

788
01:22:10,466 --> 01:22:11,433
Yashna!

789
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,466
How do you know me?

790
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:19,733
How do you know me?

791
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,700
You match exactly the way I pictured
you when Viraj was telling the story.

792
01:22:26,766 --> 01:22:28,700
But how do you know me?

793
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,466
Well, I...

794
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:32,766
How is Mahi?

795
01:23:09,233 --> 01:23:10,133
Yashna!

796
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:16,433
Yashna!

797
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:18,166
How do you know this address?

798
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,000
I got it from your office.

799
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,233
How's Mahi?

800
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,100
She's fine.

801
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,500
Since last night,

802
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,100
I've been researching her condition.

803
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,100
And according to what I read,

804
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,400
does Mahi seriously...

805
01:23:41,466 --> 01:23:42,533
That's right.

806
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:45,633
They put her in an incubator.

807
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:48,300
They said she couldn't leave the hospital.

808
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:50,533
You know what I did?

809
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,500
I came home and readied her room.

810
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:57,033
I firmly believed
that she would come home.

811
01:23:58,433 --> 01:23:59,533
In a week, she was home.

812
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,700
They said she couldn't join the nursery.

813
01:24:06,366 --> 01:24:08,266
I secured her enrollment in the school
until her 10th grade.

814
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:10,700
Now, she's first in the class.

815
01:24:16,133 --> 01:24:18,033
They said it would be a miracle
if she survived past the age of three.

816
01:24:20,766 --> 01:24:22,300
Now that miracle's age is six.

817
01:24:24,333 --> 01:24:27,166
I have planned
a wonderful 60 years for her life.

818
01:24:28,766 --> 01:24:31,633
How will I let her go if she leaves?

819
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,300
I got this thread for Mahi's well-being.

820
01:24:51,133 --> 01:24:52,266
But now I understand.

821
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:54,233
This is for you.

822
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,133
If you are safe, she remains safe.

823
01:25:02,633 --> 01:25:04,100
She is lucky to have you.

824
01:25:10,133 --> 01:25:13,133
What is 65 Roses?

825
01:25:13,366 --> 01:25:15,400
It's Cystic Fibrosis.

826
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:22,333
One day she overheard me
discussing her condition.

827
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:27,000
She couldn't pronounce it properly.

828
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,666
We never corrected her.

829
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:30,666
Can I see her once?

830
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:31,633
Not now.

831
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:35,066
Please. I won't take much time.
I promise you.

832
01:25:35,133 --> 01:25:36,533
Please try to understand.

833
01:25:37,066 --> 01:25:38,566
- She is not in the state...
- Dad...

834
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,666
Mahi!

835
01:25:58,733 --> 01:26:00,166
Are you still angry with me?

836
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:01,733
I'm sorry.

837
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:03,533
Why?

838
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,600
For my rude behavior.

839
01:26:06,766 --> 01:26:08,600
Do friends apologize to each other?

840
01:26:09,133 --> 01:26:10,700
So, are we friends?

841
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,333
Well...

842
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,733
friends usually hug and kiss each other.

843
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:36,566
You know what?
I have a surprise planned for you.

844
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:41,033
We will go out in the evening
and we will have lots of fun.

845
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,300
When will she return from her school?

846
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:44,700
Four o'clock.

847
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,466
- So, I will come by five.
- Dentist appointment at five.

848
01:26:48,566 --> 01:26:49,766
- Well, then...
- Six to eight homework.

849
01:26:50,033 --> 01:26:51,166
Dinner at eight, and nine is her bedtime.

850
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:52,566
Oh!

851
01:26:53,433 --> 01:26:55,400
Are you sure?
Can't you change her schedule?

852
01:26:57,366 --> 01:26:59,366
Dad, tomorrow is Saturday. Holiday!

853
01:27:04,233 --> 01:27:05,133
Perfect!

854
01:27:05,266 --> 01:27:06,433
Nine o'clock. Fixed!

855
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:08,233
I will reserve a table at the Hyatt.

856
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:10,133
You may also join us.

857
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:12,100
I have a surprise planned for her.

858
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:15,033
Bye, Mahi. See you in the evening.

859
01:27:15,233 --> 01:27:16,666
Sharp at nine. Don't forget.

860
01:27:17,766 --> 01:27:19,466
- Bye.
- Bye, Yashna.

861
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:20,433
See you!

862
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:21,666
See you. Love you.

863
01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:25,600
Ta-ta! Bye!

864
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,566
Bye.

865
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:27,766
Bye!

866
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:39,300
Why are you quiet?

867
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:42,100
Dumb charades?

868
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:48,000
What do you want me to say?

869
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:51,500
Are you taking Mahi
to meet her in the evening?

870
01:27:53,433 --> 01:27:54,666
No chance.

871
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,666
- Dad, my school is that way!
- You're not going to school today.

872
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,766
Justin, what shoots do we have today?

873
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,633
You'll stay here.

874
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,533
Amul and I are covering Goa.

875
01:28:14,266 --> 01:28:16,433
I'll also come to Goa.
And we're taking Mahi with us.

876
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,066
Goa?

877
01:28:20,066 --> 01:28:21,266
What about tomorrow?

878
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:22,433
Saturday is a holiday.

879
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,133
Did you forget?

880
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,366
But...

881
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,000
Yashna...

882
01:28:30,766 --> 01:28:32,433
Surprise.

883
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:35,066
Viraj, what you're doing is wrong.

884
01:28:44,266 --> 01:28:45,166
I know.

885
01:29:00,266 --> 01:29:01,466
Would she have come if she knew...

886
01:29:03,466 --> 01:29:04,433
that it was her daughter?

887
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,000
Mahi.

888
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,200
Yashna.

889
01:29:35,266 --> 01:29:36,233
It's their fate.

890
01:29:38,666 --> 01:29:40,266
How far will you keep running?

891
01:29:54,133 --> 01:29:55,033
Hi!

892
01:29:55,133 --> 01:29:57,166
She is getting married in a week.

893
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,200
Hello.

894
01:29:59,366 --> 01:30:02,600
I didn't know how to tell you.

895
01:30:14,566 --> 01:30:15,566
Brother, this is the plan.

896
01:30:16,466 --> 01:30:18,066
Here we are planning
for the pediatric division.

897
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:22,533
Mahi!

898
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,633
- Where are you?
- Goa.

899
01:30:25,266 --> 01:30:28,500
Why are you in Goa?
I waited for you last night.

900
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,633
Do you know how many times I called you?

901
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:32,033
I don't know.

902
01:30:33,533 --> 01:30:34,566
Why don't you know?

903
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,566
I don't have a phone, Yashna.

904
01:30:39,133 --> 01:30:40,200
Happy birthday, Mahi.

905
01:30:40,533 --> 01:30:42,233
May you get everything you wished for!

906
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:44,433
- Do you remember?
- Of course!

907
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:46,533
How can I forget your birthday?

908
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,400
But Dad doesn't remember.

909
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,266
Okay, I will call you later.

910
01:31:01,666 --> 01:31:02,600
Is everything okay?

911
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:08,266
This hospital will be the heart
of the country.

912
01:31:09,066 --> 01:31:11,166
In case, we leave for the US
after we get married...

913
01:31:14,366 --> 01:31:15,366
my brother will look after this place.

914
01:31:16,266 --> 01:31:17,600
He will be the managing director.

915
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,500
Aravind, I have to leave.

916
01:31:21,566 --> 01:31:23,566
- Any problem?
- Everything is fine.

917
01:31:24,266 --> 01:31:25,333
I've got some urgent work.

918
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:27,433
Sure. I can drop you off.

919
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:28,766
No, I have the car. Bye.

920
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:45,466
Did you take my phone?

921
01:31:53,033 --> 01:31:54,000
Are you lying?

922
01:31:56,033 --> 01:31:56,733
Fine.

923
01:31:57,366 --> 01:31:58,266
Don't tell Dad.

924
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:52,666
Yashna!

925
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:14,233
I thought you forgot my
birthday for the first time!

926
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,600
Ukulele! Thank you, Dad!

927
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:47,266
Mahi, come.

928
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,100
I got a special cake for you.

929
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:06,066
Hi, Viraj.

930
01:34:15,433 --> 01:34:17,766
How did Yashna
remember Mahi's birthday?

931
01:34:19,633 --> 01:34:20,666
Why wouldn't she?

932
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:24,433
Your daughter has told her everything
including your ATM pin.

933
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,600
Didn't she figure that out?

934
01:34:29,233 --> 01:34:30,300
How can she?

935
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:34,066
You replaced Yashna with Varsha
in your story.

936
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,266
Yashna didn't know that
she came to Coonoor.

937
01:34:43,133 --> 01:34:46,000
She didn't even know that
my parents were divorced.

938
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:52,133
She thinks my dad has been
with me all these years in the US.

939
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,133
He seldom meets my sister.

940
01:34:54,266 --> 01:34:55,766
I never liked you.

941
01:34:57,333 --> 01:34:58,433
Just like my mom,

942
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:02,333
I thought she had a tragic life with you.

943
01:35:06,666 --> 01:35:07,766
What changed?

944
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,200
I know a great deal about my sister.

945
01:35:27,133 --> 01:35:29,633
Giving birth to a daughter
with you says that

946
01:35:29,733 --> 01:35:31,533
she must have been in a happy marriage.

947
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,300
Please...

948
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:39,666
let Yashna be with Mahi
for at least a few days.

949
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:43,333
They planned a lot of shopping
and lunch for tomorrow.

950
01:35:45,566 --> 01:35:48,533
Dimitrov! My diva, from Russia!

951
01:35:48,733 --> 01:35:50,733
Hey, fix your hair, baby. Yeah.

952
01:35:52,633 --> 01:35:55,300
Dimitrov! You're looking beautiful!

953
01:35:55,366 --> 01:35:57,066
One more pose.
One more pose.

954
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,200
Where is Viraj?

955
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,266
Viraj is dealing with the Gone Girl. Okay.

956
01:36:01,366 --> 01:36:03,400
One more shot. One for Putin.
One for me.

957
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:04,400
No, I won't.

958
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,233
You're not Viraj.
Where is Viraj?

959
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:08,366
You're also not Deepika Padukone!

960
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,033
How insensitive!

961
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,066
Excuse me?

962
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:14,533
Did you forget me?

963
01:36:17,266 --> 01:36:19,333
Hey, Pomeranian!

964
01:36:20,566 --> 01:36:21,766
How can I forget you?

965
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,133
Oh, that reminds me.
Where is your sister?

966
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:46,700
Hi, Dad.

967
01:36:50,766 --> 01:36:51,666
Thank you for today.

968
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,633
I can't fathom
how I forgot Mahi's birthday.

969
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,200
I can never forgive myself.

970
01:37:01,533 --> 01:37:02,466
Viraj.

971
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:07,733
I met with an accident
six years ago, just like yours.

972
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:11,033
You just forgot an event.

973
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,300
I forgot a great deal.

974
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,200
But I don't regret anything.

975
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,400
Do you know why?

976
01:37:22,366 --> 01:37:26,666
I have my people who
will remember things for me.

977
01:37:29,066 --> 01:37:32,300
Similarly, even though
you forgot her birthday this time,

978
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,033
I remembered it.

979
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:36,533
So... chill!

980
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:48,300
What happened?
Why are you profoundly staring at the sea?

981
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,366
Phytoplankton algae.

982
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,300
Very rarely seen.

983
01:37:55,033 --> 01:37:57,133
Do you mean the sea will glow?

984
01:37:57,266 --> 01:37:58,200
Apparently.

985
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,033
No chance!

986
01:38:03,733 --> 01:38:05,033
What if it does?

987
01:38:06,366 --> 01:38:07,333
I will miss the photograph.

988
01:38:10,233 --> 01:38:14,333
You sat here
waiting for an unsure occurrence.

989
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:19,100
But don't you have a photograph
of your wife, who lived her life with you?

990
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:23,333
Shouldn't Mahi know
what her mother looks like?

991
01:38:27,066 --> 01:38:28,200
I don't have any photos.

992
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,100
What about the photograph you took
of her in the rain when you first saw her?

993
01:38:35,466 --> 01:38:37,100
- Don't you have that?
- I don't have them!

994
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,100
Okay. Sorry.

995
01:38:39,466 --> 01:38:42,600
I'm sorry. It's okay if you don't
want to show me a picture of hers.

996
01:38:44,566 --> 01:38:45,466
Sorry.

997
01:38:49,133 --> 01:38:52,100
At least you can describe
her looks, right?

998
01:39:00,466 --> 01:39:01,366
What?

999
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:03,100
Did you forget her appearance?

1000
01:39:03,566 --> 01:39:05,233
Don't you even remember her face?

1001
01:39:19,233 --> 01:39:20,266
Small eyes.

1002
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,766
Her smile would cause her cheeks to swell,
making her eyes appear even smaller.

1003
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,600
Her skin is like this sand's color.

1004
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,533
No matter how irked I am...

1005
01:39:38,766 --> 01:39:41,066
she has a heart-melting sight.

1006
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:45,500
Seldom she wears a sari.

1007
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:48,066
In a black sari...

1008
01:39:50,433 --> 01:39:52,633
it feels like she smeared
all the darkness on her body.

1009
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,100
A black dot on the forehead.

1010
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,266
A nose piercing...

1011
01:40:06,433 --> 01:40:07,366
balancing all the beauty.

1012
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,100
After taking a shower,
she probably intentionally...

1013
01:40:13,133 --> 01:40:14,200
leaves the hair wet.

1014
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:19,233
All the hair falls on one side...

1015
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,466
and it becomes kind of wavy.

1016
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:25,466
In one word...

1017
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,333
she looks like this.

1018
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,166
Why do you love her so much
even after she left you?

1019
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:08,500
I just described her.
Is this called love?

1020
01:41:08,733 --> 01:41:09,633
No...

1021
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,733
this is called love!

1022
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:31,066
Where is she?

1023
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,300
You know how marriages work, right?

1024
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:41,600
I think she just started to get cold feet.

1025
01:45:44,033 --> 01:45:46,133
She said beaches calm her down.

1026
01:45:47,033 --> 01:45:49,133
But if I don't allow her...

1027
01:45:50,266 --> 01:45:52,366
she said she would ask her Dad.

1028
01:45:56,233 --> 01:45:57,700
And I don't want that.

1029
01:45:59,766 --> 01:46:01,366
What's so special about the Goan beaches...

1030
01:46:04,133 --> 01:46:05,400
that you can't get on Mumbai's beaches?

1031
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:18,433
Well, my dear friends and family!

1032
01:46:19,433 --> 01:46:21,733
I have some good news
and some bad news.

1033
01:46:22,333 --> 01:46:24,400
The bad news is that
Yashna won't be joining us.

1034
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,666
But the good news is...

1035
01:46:39,366 --> 01:46:41,133
- Mahi...
- She is sleeping.

1036
01:46:42,433 --> 01:46:43,333
I will take her.

1037
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,400
Why? Let her sleep here.

1038
01:46:45,666 --> 01:46:46,566
Hey.

1039
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,333
- It's okay.
- Viraj.

1040
01:46:49,566 --> 01:46:51,266
Come on! It's just one day.

1041
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,533
I'm sorry. I insist.
Please don't mind.

1042
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:02,566
Why do you have to be so stubborn?

1043
01:47:02,666 --> 01:47:04,300
What will happen over one night?

1044
01:47:04,366 --> 01:47:05,266
You are here today.

1045
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,500
What about tomorrow?

1046
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
What if she becomes accustomed to you?

1047
01:47:10,166 --> 01:47:12,266
So, you'll be harsh and take her away?

1048
01:47:12,433 --> 01:47:14,000
You know how happy she was today?

1049
01:47:14,066 --> 01:47:15,566
You don't know a girl's needs.

1050
01:47:15,633 --> 01:47:17,066
She needs a feminine touch.

1051
01:47:17,366 --> 01:47:19,266
- She needs female parenting.
- Buying a few accessories...

1052
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:23,433
and clothes is not parenting.

1053
01:47:25,266 --> 01:47:27,433
I'm not in a position to hear it from you.

1054
01:47:31,633 --> 01:47:32,566
Vacation is over, right?

1055
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:34,666
Please leave us alone.

1056
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:55,066
Was she hurt?

1057
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,133
A lot.

1058
01:48:00,333 --> 01:48:01,233
What to do?

1059
01:48:01,666 --> 01:48:03,033
Go get my sister!

1060
01:48:15,466 --> 01:48:16,366
One shot.

1061
01:48:23,133 --> 01:48:24,533
You have to do a shot.

1062
01:48:25,033 --> 01:48:25,733
Come on.

1063
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:31,366
- Hey!
- You are such a baby!

1064
01:48:31,466 --> 01:48:33,533
Can't you do one shot?

1065
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:57,266
I heard your love story

1066
01:51:57,733 --> 01:52:00,500
and imagined it as a great one.

1067
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,633
And here you're getting drunk
and dancing with heroines.

1068
01:52:05,033 --> 01:52:05,766
Shame!

1069
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,433
God, I wish that kid didn't give me
that puppy back.

1070
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,066
My life would have been blissful.

1071
01:52:17,300 --> 01:52:19,266
What kid? What did you just say?

1072
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,266
I dare you to speak loudly.

1073
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,000
Speak loudly? Then listen!

1074
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,500
Your wiring in the brain
got screwed in that accident!

1075
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,666
You don't have the wiring
in the first place.

1076
01:52:38,666 --> 01:52:39,666
Hey!

1077
01:52:40,566 --> 01:52:45,000
Speak about anything but my accident!

1078
01:52:46,133 --> 01:52:47,400
What will you do?

1079
01:52:47,566 --> 01:52:49,000
- What will you do?
- Will you hit me?

1080
01:52:49,066 --> 01:52:50,666
Hit me, come on! Hit me!

1081
01:52:50,733 --> 01:52:51,633
One minute.

1082
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:54,066
Why are we openly discussing things?

1083
01:52:55,266 --> 01:52:57,466
Oh, you won't remember this by morning!

1084
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,133
So far, you deleted
everything selectively.

1085
01:53:03,233 --> 01:53:04,766
I won't forget.

1086
01:53:05,166 --> 01:53:07,033
I remember everything.

1087
01:53:08,066 --> 01:53:09,066
- Is it?
- Yes.

1088
01:53:23,333 --> 01:53:24,566
Say it again.

1089
01:53:26,466 --> 01:53:28,166
I don't forget anything.

1090
01:53:28,233 --> 01:53:29,166
Five seconds.

1091
01:53:29,233 --> 01:53:32,500
One, two, three, four, five.

1092
01:53:32,566 --> 01:53:34,033
Repeat what you just said.

1093
01:53:34,566 --> 01:53:35,466
What?

1094
01:53:35,533 --> 01:53:37,366
You don't remember
what you just said.

1095
01:53:39,166 --> 01:53:40,333
What did you say the other day?

1096
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:46,366
You have people who
will remember things for you.

1097
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:49,633
That's why I have no regrets.

1098
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,333
Why will you have regrets?

1099
01:53:54,433 --> 01:53:57,133
The one next to you...

1100
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:00,033
with all the memory...

1101
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,733
will have regrets.

1102
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,600
You enjoy your shopping and your wedding.

1103
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:11,766
You turn a blind eye to
what others are going through.

1104
01:54:12,033 --> 01:54:15,366
Superb! Amazing!

1105
01:54:15,533 --> 01:54:16,766
Wow, superb!

1106
01:54:17,233 --> 01:54:19,166
- How dare you?
- Don't hit me!

1107
01:54:19,333 --> 01:54:20,566
Don't hit me!

1108
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,300
Don't you dare!

1109
01:54:24,466 --> 01:54:26,533
- Don't hit me.
- How dare you, Viraj!

1110
01:54:29,366 --> 01:54:30,333
Let go!

1111
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I will...

1112
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,000
Go to sleep.

1113
01:55:09,533 --> 01:55:10,433
Hi.

1114
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:55,066
Yashna.

1115
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,633
Can I ask you something?

1116
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:09,133
Will you stay with us forever?

1117
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:36,633
You seem quite confident
that we'll be blessed with a girl.

1118
01:56:37,433 --> 01:56:39,333
What did you think about the baby's name?

1119
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:44,000
Mahima.

1120
01:56:47,366 --> 01:56:48,266
Mahi.

1121
01:57:13,133 --> 01:57:16,233
Apparently, Dimitrov has a boyfriend.
But Selena doesn't have one.

1122
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:18,100
Justin. Where is Viraj?

1123
01:57:23,133 --> 01:57:24,033
That's it, sir.

1124
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:25,400
We are saving her.

1125
01:57:25,733 --> 01:57:27,500
It's not about the lungs.

1126
01:57:28,633 --> 01:57:31,266
It's about Mahi's condition and her age.

1127
01:57:39,466 --> 01:57:43,066
If you leave her like this,
she might survive another six years.

1128
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:46,300
Why are you taking her chances away?

1129
01:57:47,666 --> 01:57:48,733
Earlier, you said three years.

1130
01:57:50,666 --> 01:57:52,000
Now you are saying six.

1131
01:57:53,333 --> 01:57:54,733
When were you right?
Then or now?

1132
01:57:57,533 --> 01:58:00,766
We are getting what we've always wanted.

1133
01:58:04,533 --> 01:58:05,600
We don't have a choice.

1134
01:58:11,466 --> 01:58:12,733
We're getting this operation done.

1135
01:58:13,666 --> 01:58:14,633
No matter what.

1136
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,700
Whatever may be the percentage.

1137
01:58:28,366 --> 01:58:29,266
Viraj.

1138
01:58:31,366 --> 01:58:33,266
Were you aware that
you would have a daughter?

1139
01:58:35,733 --> 01:58:38,433
Mahi was the name of the girl
who gave you Pluto, right?

1140
01:58:41,733 --> 01:58:42,666
What are you saying?

1141
01:58:43,466 --> 01:58:44,766
I'm not understanding anything.

1142
01:58:45,566 --> 01:58:49,500
More than Mahi,
I might've imagined myself as Varsha.

1143
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:54,366
I'm dreaming about things that
I didn't hear in your story.

1144
01:58:58,166 --> 01:59:00,533
I assumed all this was
because of my accident.

1145
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,766
Because of my overthinking.

1146
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:05,300
Because of my crazy fondness for Mahi.

1147
01:59:17,733 --> 01:59:21,166
I like you... Viraj.

1148
01:59:24,566 --> 01:59:25,766
I'm not assuming it.

1149
01:59:28,033 --> 01:59:29,033
I know it already.

1150
01:59:32,733 --> 01:59:33,666
Do you like me?

1151
01:59:52,366 --> 01:59:53,266
Sister-in-law.

1152
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,300
You are here.

1153
01:59:55,466 --> 01:59:57,100
I was searching for you in the resort.

1154
02:00:01,433 --> 02:00:03,100
What? Are you surprised to see me?

1155
02:00:04,033 --> 02:00:05,400
There is a bigger surprise
waiting for you.

1156
02:00:05,566 --> 02:00:07,066
Come. We're leaving.

1157
02:00:14,066 --> 02:00:15,100
Sister-in-law.

1158
02:00:17,533 --> 02:00:18,433
Neha.

1159
02:01:01,766 --> 02:01:03,333
Were you scared of the wedding
all of a sudden?

1160
02:01:08,233 --> 02:01:09,700
I heard these beaches calm you down.

1161
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:14,333
So, I brought the whole
wedding here for you.

1162
02:01:17,033 --> 02:01:17,766
You heard me, right?

1163
02:01:19,466 --> 02:01:20,633
That's Yashna.

1164
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:24,000
My fiancée.

1165
02:01:29,166 --> 02:01:30,633
Did she have a
dream or was that true?

1166
02:01:34,033 --> 02:01:35,033
Fine, don't tell me.

1167
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,200
But she returned
and expressed her feelings for you.

1168
02:01:37,533 --> 02:01:38,766
At least tell her.

1169
02:01:39,233 --> 02:01:40,133
And what?

1170
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:41,366
You can get your life back!

1171
02:01:41,766 --> 02:01:43,500
Or start a new one altogether.

1172
02:01:45,033 --> 02:01:45,733
And then?

1173
02:01:46,333 --> 02:01:47,500
Don't be stubborn.

1174
02:01:47,733 --> 02:01:51,233
You, Yashna, and
Mahi can live happily.

1175
02:01:57,233 --> 02:01:59,166
Mahi, Yashna, and I.

1176
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:09,200
Happy?

1177
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:26,566
Yashna!

1178
02:02:38,066 --> 02:02:39,166
Yashna!

1179
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:56,466
Yashna!

1180
02:03:19,166 --> 02:03:21,533
Dad... Yashna!

1181
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:56,533
I really need you, Dad.

1182
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:04,466
I really like someone.

1183
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:11,266
His name is Viraj.

1184
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,233
I have to meet Yashna.

1185
02:05:19,700 --> 02:05:21,400
I have to ask her something.

1186
02:05:24,033 --> 02:05:27,466
Mahi, you're aware that
her wedding is tomorrow.

1187
02:05:28,033 --> 02:05:29,166
We shouldn't disturb her.

1188
02:05:29,566 --> 02:05:31,066
Please, Dad.

1189
02:05:32,066 --> 02:05:33,233
We're going back to Mumbai tomorrow.

1190
02:05:34,733 --> 02:05:37,366
I have an important meeting.
You go to bed.

1191
02:05:50,733 --> 02:05:51,666
Pluto.

1192
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,100
Mahi.

1193
02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:03,566
I didn't find her.

1194
02:06:05,733 --> 02:06:06,633
Wait.

1195
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:09,433
Where is Yashna's wedding?

1196
02:06:17,333 --> 02:06:19,000
You guys did a fantastic job!

1197
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:22,600
Look for Yashna.

1198
02:06:23,533 --> 02:06:24,533
But...

1199
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:28,400
Mahi?

1200
02:06:30,166 --> 02:06:31,066
Hey!

1201
02:06:31,533 --> 02:06:32,433
Looking for someone?

1202
02:06:33,133 --> 02:06:35,300
Yashna. My daughter...

1203
02:06:35,366 --> 02:06:36,266
- Yashna?
- Yeah.

1204
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:37,500
This way.

1205
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,566
It took two days to shop for everything...

1206
02:06:46,633 --> 02:06:47,666
Yashna.

1207
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:50,066
Hi! Come here!

1208
02:06:50,266 --> 02:06:51,166
Hey!

1209
02:07:10,733 --> 02:07:11,633
Mahi!

1210
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,766
Where are you going?
Dad is looking for you!

1211
02:07:15,266 --> 02:07:17,200
Uncle, I need to talk to Yashna.

1212
02:07:17,366 --> 02:07:18,266
Come here!

1213
02:07:18,633 --> 02:07:19,600
Two minutes!

1214
02:07:20,433 --> 02:07:22,533
- Please!
- No, Mahi. Listen to me...

1215
02:07:40,266 --> 02:07:42,233
I think there is a misunderstanding.

1216
02:07:51,633 --> 02:07:55,200
He promised that he would never
show up again in our lives.

1217
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:56,200
Is that why...

1218
02:07:57,266 --> 02:08:00,066
he sent you and his daughter?

1219
02:08:00,466 --> 02:08:03,066
You're unnecessarily worrying, ma'am.

1220
02:08:03,166 --> 02:08:05,366
I'm here to take the child away.
That's it.

1221
02:08:05,466 --> 02:08:09,366
My daughter survived
that accident,

1222
02:08:10,733 --> 02:08:12,033
not his wife.

1223
02:08:12,266 --> 02:08:13,466
No, ma'am.

1224
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,666
Ma'am, please lower your voice.

1225
02:08:17,033 --> 02:08:18,100
Mahi doesn't know anything.

1226
02:08:18,266 --> 02:08:21,000
Did she come this far
without knowing anything?

1227
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,000
Did they meet her without any plan?

1228
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:44,000
Can Yashna bear the news that...

1229
02:08:44,733 --> 02:08:47,100
her child won't live long enough?

1230
02:08:49,366 --> 02:08:50,266
Gosh...

1231
02:08:50,333 --> 02:08:53,266
- I'm not sure what your Dad has told you.
- Ma'am, please.

1232
02:08:53,333 --> 02:08:55,133
- But let me tell you.
- Please, ma'am.

1233
02:08:55,233 --> 02:08:56,133
Please, ma'am.

1234
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:59,200
- Please, ma'am.
- Yashna doesn't remember

1235
02:08:59,266 --> 02:09:00,233
that you're her daughter.

1236
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,033
You too should forget
that she is your mother.

1237
02:09:09,033 --> 02:09:10,000
Ashok!

1238
02:09:15,433 --> 02:09:16,333
Please leave.

1239
02:09:16,433 --> 02:09:17,533
Do you know what he did?

1240
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:18,500
I said go!

1241
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:35,233
Viraj, right?

1242
02:09:37,733 --> 02:09:38,633
I know you.

1243
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:43,066
I'm sorry for what my brother did.
He is a bit...

1244
02:09:45,166 --> 02:09:46,066
I'm Aravind.

1245
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:48,566
I'm the one marrying your ex-wife.

1246
02:09:51,166 --> 02:09:53,766
I don't have a problem
if your arrival is a coincidence.

1247
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,566
But if it's planned...

1248
02:09:57,033 --> 02:09:58,366
then we both have a problem.

1249
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:01,433
She has suffered enough because of you.

1250
02:10:04,666 --> 02:10:05,733
I suggest you leave.

1251
02:10:13,666 --> 02:10:14,566
Pluto!

1252
02:10:15,533 --> 02:10:16,433
Mahi!

1253
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:17,400
Where is Mahi?

1254
02:10:17,466 --> 02:10:18,366
Mahi!

1255
02:10:20,566 --> 02:10:21,500
Pluto!

1256
02:10:29,633 --> 02:10:30,533
Dad.

1257
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,300
Where did you go, Mahi?

1258
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,466
Do you know how scared I was?

1259
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:50,266
You left once for not telling
your Mom's story.

1260
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,100
Now you are leaving searching for Yashna.

1261
02:10:59,166 --> 02:11:00,633
Do you remember that I'm here?

1262
02:11:06,066 --> 02:11:08,133
Did you never feel like
waiting for your Dad?

1263
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:17,066
Where did I go so wrong?

1264
02:11:21,266 --> 02:11:22,333
Where?

1265
02:11:30,033 --> 02:11:32,133
Isn't my love enough, Mahi?

1266
02:11:45,466 --> 02:11:48,166
I won't leave you again, Dad.

1267
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:54,600
Take me wherever you go this time.

1268
02:11:58,100 --> 02:11:59,466
You wanted to ask Yashna something, right?

1269
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,500
Did you?

1270
02:12:04,433 --> 02:12:05,333
Why?

1271
02:12:06,366 --> 02:12:07,666
65 Roses.

1272
02:12:09,066 --> 02:12:11,000
Mom will cry, Dad.

1273
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,266
Sorry.

1274
02:12:14,133 --> 02:12:15,266
I tried really hard.

1275
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:17,733
Aunty spilled the beans.

1276
02:12:36,466 --> 02:12:37,366
Pluto!

1277
02:12:49,233 --> 02:12:50,433
You came for me, right?

1278
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,566
You really like me a lot, right?

1279
02:12:55,133 --> 02:12:56,433
Just tell me you like me.

1280
02:12:58,566 --> 02:13:00,333
I will leave everything behind
and come with you.

1281
02:13:02,366 --> 02:13:03,366
Aren't you ashamed?

1282
02:13:06,566 --> 02:13:08,366
You're about to get married to someone...

1283
02:13:09,066 --> 02:13:10,733
and you want to elope with me?

1284
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,433
What kind of a character is yours?

1285
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,366
I'm not sure why you
imagined yourself as Varsha.

1286
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:25,133
But you are similar in one aspect.

1287
02:13:26,566 --> 02:13:30,066
You both tend to run away from problems.

1288
02:13:33,066 --> 02:13:33,766
Just give up.

1289
02:13:37,166 --> 02:13:39,533
You are insulting me for being honest.

1290
02:13:43,166 --> 02:13:45,566
Mahi, did you hear what your father said?

1291
02:13:47,266 --> 02:13:48,166
Mahi...

1292
02:13:50,766 --> 02:13:53,233
Mahi... you tell me.

1293
02:13:53,600 --> 02:13:55,233
Didn't you imagine me as your mother?

1294
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:58,000
I did.

1295
02:13:58,566 --> 02:14:00,400
But you are not my real mother.

1296
02:14:43,066 --> 02:14:43,766
Take Mahi with you.

1297
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:54,000
Go on.

1298
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,066
Deal with me.

1299
02:15:50,166 --> 02:15:51,066
I'll bear it.

1300
02:15:54,266 --> 02:15:55,566
But dealing with Mahi...

1301
02:16:01,366 --> 02:16:05,333
You've revealed the secret
I hid from my daughter.

1302
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,300
Should I reveal your secrets
to your daughter?

1303
02:16:47,333 --> 02:16:48,266
What happened?

1304
02:16:48,566 --> 02:16:49,500
Mahi!

1305
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:50,600
- Mahi!
- Mahi!

1306
02:16:51,033 --> 02:16:52,000
- Mahi!
- Mahi!

1307
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:53,400
Mahi!

1308
02:16:56,433 --> 02:16:57,333
Doctor!

1309
02:17:05,733 --> 02:17:07,100
Mahi, wake up.

1310
02:17:17,066 --> 02:17:18,133
Mahi, wake up.

1311
02:17:53,266 --> 02:17:54,166
Yashna.

1312
02:17:59,033 --> 02:18:00,533
So, you're...

1313
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,600
you're getting married?

1314
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,433
You finally got the time?

1315
02:18:06,266 --> 02:18:08,400
I had some important work.

1316
02:18:10,066 --> 02:18:13,600
What is more important than your
daughter's wedding, Dad?

1317
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:49,033
You like Viraj, right?

1318
02:18:49,299 --> 02:18:51,299
Why are you marrying Aravind?

1319
02:18:51,466 --> 02:18:54,100
He doesn't like me.

1320
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,566
I thought at least his daughter liked me.

1321
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:01,000
She was worse than him.

1322
02:19:02,166 --> 02:19:05,666
He insulted me for confessing my love.

1323
02:19:07,666 --> 02:19:09,266
He compared me with his wife.

1324
02:19:10,066 --> 02:19:12,266
He said that we are similar.

1325
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:17,766
What he said was right.

1326
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,166
Right?

1327
02:19:27,066 --> 02:19:29,233
Is that what you think of me?

1328
02:19:30,066 --> 02:19:31,433
When did I ever give up, Dad?

1329
02:19:33,299 --> 02:19:34,200
You know...

1330
02:19:34,733 --> 02:19:36,166
it's not when he said so.

1331
02:19:36,433 --> 02:19:40,166
When you gave up fighting for
your love after what he said.

1332
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,433
That's when you behaved like his wife.

1333
02:19:46,166 --> 02:19:48,466
What else can I do, Dad?

1334
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,533
Prove that you're not like his wife

1335
02:19:51,766 --> 02:19:55,033
and you won't run
away from problems.

1336
02:19:57,733 --> 02:20:02,566
His only daughter is in the ICU,
fighting for her life.

1337
02:20:03,333 --> 02:20:06,300
She may or may not make it.

1338
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:11,166
Yashna, will you stand
with him and fight

1339
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:13,433
or will you give up like his wife?

1340
02:20:15,333 --> 02:20:18,133
It's... your call.

1341
02:20:20,566 --> 02:20:21,500
Yashna...

1342
02:20:22,633 --> 02:20:24,100
we are running late.

1343
02:20:26,033 --> 02:20:27,533
You can speak to your dad later.

1344
02:20:28,166 --> 02:20:29,066
Go.

1345
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:31,033
Everyone is waiting. Go.

1346
02:20:31,366 --> 02:20:32,266
Dad.

1347
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:34,200
What?

1348
02:20:35,666 --> 02:20:38,266
It's your life. You love him.

1349
02:20:38,666 --> 02:20:40,366
You must battle.

1350
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:50,066
Everyone is waiting.

1351
02:20:51,533 --> 02:20:52,433
Let's go.

1352
02:21:30,366 --> 02:21:31,266
What happened?

1353
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,400
Aravind, I have to go.

1354
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:38,366
What are you even saying?

1355
02:21:38,666 --> 02:21:39,566
Is it Viraj?

1356
02:21:40,333 --> 02:21:41,433
Do you know Viraj?

1357
02:21:44,666 --> 02:21:47,166
Fine, you can leave
if you don't want this marriage.

1358
02:21:48,666 --> 02:21:50,766
But he isn't the right guy for you.

1359
02:21:51,433 --> 02:21:52,633
How can you say that?

1360
02:21:53,366 --> 02:21:56,233
You don't know how much
his wife suffered because of him.

1361
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,600
Even he suffered a lot.

1362
02:22:00,233 --> 02:22:01,366
She wanted a divorce.

1363
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,500
- No, she didn't.
- She did.

1364
02:22:07,733 --> 02:22:08,766
She must not have.

1365
02:22:09,133 --> 02:22:11,533
- I'm telling you, she asked for a divorce.
- I didn't ask for it!

1366
02:22:24,066 --> 02:22:25,033
I'm sorry.

1367
02:22:28,033 --> 02:22:29,500
She must not have asked for it.

1368
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:34,200
This just... doesn't add up.

1369
02:22:35,766 --> 02:22:36,766
How could she?

1370
02:22:38,333 --> 02:22:39,300
She didn't.

1371
02:22:40,333 --> 02:22:41,533
She didn't.

1372
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:45,033
She didn't.

1373
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:53,600
She didn't.

1374
02:22:58,566 --> 02:22:59,466
Go.

1375
02:23:01,066 --> 02:23:01,766
Aravind!

1376
02:23:07,433 --> 02:23:09,100
Leave before I change my mind.

1377
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,266
Are you insane?

1378
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:30,300
Why did you leave her?

1379
02:23:32,766 --> 02:23:34,233
Tell me something.

1380
02:23:34,366 --> 02:23:36,600
Did Yashna really ask for
a divorce before the accident?

1381
02:23:38,233 --> 02:23:39,133
Did she?

1382
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:42,033
I thought so!

1383
02:23:45,033 --> 02:23:46,500
She must leave him first...

1384
02:23:48,166 --> 02:23:49,400
to love me.

1385
02:23:50,766 --> 02:23:52,633
They beat him up unnecessarily.

1386
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,000
Ashok.

1387
02:24:04,366 --> 02:24:06,566
Is he more important than your family?

1388
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:11,533
You ruined your daughter's wedding.

1389
02:24:12,666 --> 02:24:14,466
My daughter got married long ago.

1390
02:24:15,633 --> 02:24:17,100
You didn't attend it

1391
02:24:17,533 --> 02:24:19,366
I saved it now.

1392
02:24:20,033 --> 02:24:20,733
That's it.

1393
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,400
That's not even a marriage,
and it was not even a life she led!

1394
02:24:25,500 --> 02:24:28,400
Is tying the knot with someone
and living life on your terms

1395
02:24:28,633 --> 02:24:30,633
called marriage and life?

1396
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:36,266
It will take you a lifetime
to find someone like Viraj for her.

1397
02:24:37,666 --> 02:24:40,633
Yes... he is more important than you.

1398
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:43,166
That accident proved a point.

1399
02:24:58,433 --> 02:25:01,133
That's why I went to them.
I stayed with him.

1400
02:25:03,066 --> 02:25:05,333
There's no seminar owing to
Mahi's condition that he didn't attend.

1401
02:25:17,733 --> 02:25:19,033
He continues to do so.

1402
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:30,200
It won't take a second for him
to demolish the glass castle

1403
02:25:30,333 --> 02:25:31,666
you built for Yashna.

1404
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:34,433
But he wouldn't do that.

1405
02:25:35,366 --> 02:25:38,233
Regardless of what you think, he loves...

1406
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:44,366
your daughter a bit more
than his daughter.

1407
02:26:13,166 --> 02:26:14,300
Some marriages are like that.

1408
02:26:15,133 --> 02:26:17,233
No matter how hard you try,
they just won't work out.

1409
02:26:17,533 --> 02:26:20,033
They fail like this one.

1410
02:26:20,666 --> 02:26:21,666
Like ours.

1411
02:26:35,066 --> 02:26:36,166
We failed as a couple.

1412
02:26:38,033 --> 02:26:40,733
Let's not fail as parents.

1413
02:26:42,033 --> 02:26:43,033
Please.

1414
02:26:50,666 --> 02:26:54,400
She said she would
never leave me again.

1415
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,500
She isn't responding to me now.

1416
02:27:05,366 --> 02:27:06,333
Everyone thought...

1417
02:27:07,600 --> 02:27:09,433
Mahi survived because of me.

1418
02:27:11,366 --> 02:27:12,266
No.

1419
02:27:13,700 --> 02:27:15,300
I survived because of Mahi.

1420
02:27:19,733 --> 02:27:20,700
I'm scared.

1421
02:27:41,166 --> 02:27:42,133
Look at me.

1422
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,633
I left my wedding and came for you...

1423
02:27:46,433 --> 02:27:50,300
after knowing you just for seven days.

1424
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,733
She is your daughter.

1425
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,233
How will she leave you?

1426
02:27:58,566 --> 02:28:01,066
If you cry, she will lose.

1427
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,766
You must fight for her.
She will win.

1428
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:08,233
Nothing will happen to Mahi.

1429
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:13,100
Promise.

1430
02:28:20,166 --> 02:28:21,066
Promise.

1431
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:53,166
His daughter is in the ICU.
I didn't feel like hurting him.

1432
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:57,033
It's Cystic Fibrosis.

1433
02:28:59,033 --> 02:29:00,533
The survival rate is zero percent.

1434
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:06,333
We have a lung, right?

1435
02:29:06,766 --> 02:29:08,033
What is stopping us?

1436
02:29:08,233 --> 02:29:09,633
But if we operate...

1437
02:29:11,733 --> 02:29:12,766
the child won't survive.

1438
02:29:13,033 --> 02:29:14,266
Will she survive if we don't?

1439
02:29:21,366 --> 02:29:25,300
This hospital is not equipped with
qualified doctors to perform surgery.

1440
02:29:26,466 --> 02:29:30,200
It has to be done under the guidance
of the likes of critical care,

1441
02:29:30,333 --> 02:29:32,366
pulmonologists, and so many others.

1442
02:29:33,466 --> 02:29:34,700
Sir, that's Arjun Srivastav.

1443
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:38,033
He is a senior consultant and
