1
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,474
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

2
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,391
Yes, I do.

3
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,854
- Do you want to sign up here?
- You know what? I...

4
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:05,107
It's funny, I actually signed up for this,
but I never heard from you guys.

5
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:11,447
- Thank you so much. Have a good day.
- Good luck.

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,618
- Just call him.
- [Charlie] I'm not calling.

7
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,414
Call him.

8
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,023
Yeah!

9
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,010
- [Charlie] Hmm.
- [Nicole] Note the wrapping.

10
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,145
[blowing]

11
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,318
Uh... [blows]

12
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,528
- [shrieks]
- [laughs]

13
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,532
- Lizard?
- Yeah.

14
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,668
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

15
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:49,086
All right.

16
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,464
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

17
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:54,800
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

18
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,177
Goddamn it!

19
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,878
[laughing]

20
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,276
[stomps]

21
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,614
[Charlie] Let's try it...

22
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,450
crawling...

23
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,830
but also standing.

24
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,974
[Henry] And he liked me, so...

25
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,317
[muffled] Is your sweater on backwards?

26
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:42,825
So...

27
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,371
Hey.

28
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,541
Sorry.

29
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,004
I cried four times.

30
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:55,921
Me too.

31
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,258
I wonder if it was the same four.

32
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,476
[Charlie] How are we doing over here?

33
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,727
The peppers are cut.

34
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,232
...cut some carrots.

35
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,823
[speaks indistinctly]

36
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,164
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

37
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,958
Oh, come on!

38
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,253
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- [Henry] Me.

39
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,338
[Charlie] How much is it?

40
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,340
- I don't have enough.
- $450.

41
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,675
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

42
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,303
This is so frustrating!

43
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,515
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

44
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,566
I had a bad dream.

45
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,528
It's okay.

46
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,454
Dad, stay.

47
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,071
Shit.

48
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,864
- [Henry] What's "shit?"
- This is our stop.

49
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,793
[Charlie] Did you get it? Perfect.

50
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,974
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they're coming with a camcorder.

51
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,475
- Camcorder.
- Is that what they're called?

52
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,941
I made sure they used
the right almond milk.

53
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:21,859
Genius.

54
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,084
- And where do you go when it's windy?
- [laughs]

55
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,504
[chuckles]

56
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,601
Let's stop right there.

57
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,373
[man] Who wants to start?

58
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,293
[Nicole inhales]

59
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,674
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

60
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,761
Why is that?

61
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,471
Because I don't like what I wrote.

62
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,351
As we mediate your separation

63
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,603
and eventual divorce,

64
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,190
things can get quite contentious.

65
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,694
So, I like to begin
with a note of positivity,

66
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:51,323
for the people I work with to remember
why they got married in the first place.

67
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,368
And so that, as you come apart,

68
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,078
you're reminded that...

69
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,790
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

70
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,960
and maybe still do in many ways.

71
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,424
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

72
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,218
For it to really work,

73
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,220
you both have to read.

74
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,388
I'm not going to.

75
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:16,515
Okay, urn...

76
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,853
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

77
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,522
uh, the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

78
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,775
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

79
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,236
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

80
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,738
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

81
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,072
We promised to listen.

82
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:33,741
That's right.

83
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,535
That's the very first step
in this process.

84
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,373
Well, I think I'm going to go
if you two are going to just sit around

85
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,500
and suck each other's dicks.

86
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,131
[door opens, closes]

87
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,094
[Nicole]
How can this evil allow moderation?

88
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,012
[performers thud]

89
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,972
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

90
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,056
[performers grunt]

91
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,267
How is it human to be so...

92
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,561
faithless?

93
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,229
- [performers grunt]
- [recording continues]

94
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,482
I want no praise from impious men.

95
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,399
[performers grunt]

96
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,860
No home with them of quiet ease.

97
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,988
- [performers grunt]
- Noble blood still runs in my veins.

98
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,033
Shall I fail my father...

99
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,035
stifling my cries,

100
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,245
clipping the wings of grief?

101
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:24,958
Must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away,

102
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,376
feebly count for nothing?

103
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,339
[Nicole] Must his killers gloat,

104
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,383
never to pay with blood, for blood...

105
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,428
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

106
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:38,972
- He told me to pick up my cues.
- How is that for me?

107
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,766
[Frank] Acting is reacting.

108
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,185
[Frank] I'm responding to you.
You're slowing me down.

109
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,270
[man] Frank, it's closing night, you know.

110
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,607
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

111
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,693
No, I think this time it's really over.

112
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:55,656
- It still feels weird.
- I feel like my parents are splitting up.

113
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,533
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

114
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,826
- Is Charlie still giving notes?
- Yep.

115
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,577
You're lucky, Nic.
I wish I was going to LA.

116
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,871
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

117
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,122
[glass clinking]

118
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,625
Ladies and gentlemen,

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,627
I want to make a toast

120
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,379
to Charlie...

121
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,257
and to our beloved Nicole,

122
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,970
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure,

123
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,348
all the way to sunny California.

124
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,810
And we are also going to try
something new.

125
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,855
We are going to take our play to Broadway.

126
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,482
[cheering and applause]

127
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:33,402
It reminds me of when I was a young person

128
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,779
and went to Broadway for the first time.

129
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,447
And I'm telling you,

130
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,993
winning your first Tony at 27,

131
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,203
it can mess with your head.

132
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:46,832
I mean, I was just a baby.
Elia Kazan was backstage...

133
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,542
[Mary Ann] I'm going to go over there now.

134
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,128
- [Donna] Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- [Frank] ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

135
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,755
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

136
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,010
and Marlene, you know,
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

137
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:01,763
but tonight she was very, very serious.

138
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,974
Could you give me a second?

139
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:07,603
[wheels squeaking]

140
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,373
[Nicole] Hey.

141
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,710
Oh. Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

142
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,504
- How's he doing?
- Good, good. He went to bed on time.

143
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,422
No fuss.

144
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,552
God, you guys are so attractive.

145
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:41,929
[chuckles]

146
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,723
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

147
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,682
[chuckles]

148
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:46,975
[Charlie] No, it's okay.

149
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,728
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

150
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,689
[babysitter] Hey, thanks.
And also the travel time.

151
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,703
[turns on TV]

152
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:12,125
[continues indistinct]
...if you know what / mean.

153
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,765
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

154
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,892
- [Nicole] Yeah.
- W-We might not need a mediator.

155
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,936
We'll just split everything anyway,
I don't care.

156
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,563
- Me neither.
- [Charlie] You can have most of it.

157
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,066
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

158
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,025
We'll figure it out.

159
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,902
- We want the same things.
- Right.

160
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,321
In the meantime,
the pilot will be fun for you.

161
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,198
[sighs]

162
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,951
You don't think it's bad, do you?

163
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,162
I don't ever watch TV,
so, you know, I can't tell.

164
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,504
Uh-huh.

165
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,008
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

166
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,429
Yes?

167
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,639
Nothing.

168
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,560
I can tell you want to give me a note.

169
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,644
No, I don't.

170
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:18,567
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

171
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,155
I guess it doesn't matter now.
You won't be with the show anymore.

172
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,239
It's stupid.

173
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,951
You're not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me.

174
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:29,995
[Charlie] Maybe not.

175
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,330
Okay, then.

176
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,166
[Charlie] So, there are two things.

177
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,712
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

178
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,631
- Okay.
- And then...

179
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,886
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

180
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,888
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

181
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:50,474
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

182
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,935
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

183
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,229
it didn't.

184
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,148
That's all I had.

185
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:01,985
Thanks for indulging me.

186
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,241
Good night, Charlie.

187
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:27,427
[sobbing]

188
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,836
G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

189
01:58:02,409 --> 01:58:03,327
[speaks indistinctly]

190
01:58:13,671 --> 01:58:14,505
[laughter]

191
02:01:40,294 --> 02:01:42,337
It's true, but there's more than that.

192
02:01:42,713 --> 02:01:44,256
Is that all you think there is to it?

193
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:46,717
You have so many reasons
for not being with someone, Robert,

194
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,802
but you haven't got one good reason
for being alone.

195
02:01:48,886 --> 02:01:51,388
C'mon, you're onto something.
Robbie, you're onto something.

196
02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:21,335
[cheering and applause]

197
02:02:21,418 --> 02:02:24,755
Blow out the candles, Robert,
and make a wish.

198
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:26,131
Want something.

199
02:02:26,924 --> 02:02:28,300
Want something.

200
02:04:24,916 --> 02:04:26,001
[piano stops playing]

201
02:04:27,669 --> 02:04:29,671
[exhales]

202
02:04:36,136 --> 02:04:37,554
[birds chirping]

203
02:04:38,597 --> 02:04:39,806
[locks car]

204
02:04:40,474 --> 02:04:41,642
[running footsteps]

205
02:04:41,725 --> 02:04:43,101
- Hello?
- [toy gun firing]

206
02:04:43,185 --> 02:04:44,394
[running footsteps]

207
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:46,855
[toy gun firing]

208
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:49,566
[running footsteps]

209
02:04:52,778 --> 02:04:54,112
- Hello?
- [toy gun firing]

210
02:04:55,781 --> 02:04:57,908
- Hi. Sorry, the door was open.
- Shh.

211
02:04:58,867 --> 02:04:59,910
Oh, okay.

212
02:05:02,162 --> 02:05:03,372
Whoa! Gotcha!

213
02:05:03,455 --> 02:05:04,456
Aah!

214
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:06,375
Oh, Charlie!

215
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:09,461
[laughing] Oh! Was your flight okay?

216
02:05:09,544 --> 02:05:11,004
- Yeah.
- Carter.

217
02:05:11,088 --> 02:05:12,172
Charlie.

218
02:05:12,255 --> 02:05:13,423
Nicole's still at work.

219
02:05:20,972 --> 02:05:22,224
- [Charlie] Hi.
- Hi.

220
02:05:22,307 --> 02:05:23,684
Can I get a hug?

221
02:05:28,563 --> 02:05:29,981
- Hey, how'd it go?
- [Nicole] Hey.

222
02:05:30,065 --> 02:05:33,068
Good, yeah. Donny's dead now. We shot
the scene where he merges with the ficus.

223
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:35,237
- [Sandra] Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

224
02:05:35,654 --> 02:05:38,115
- She's a great actress.
- No, for directing.

225
02:05:39,783 --> 02:05:41,618
- Congratulations.
- [Nicole] Thanks.

226
02:05:41,702 --> 02:05:44,496
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

227
02:05:44,579 --> 02:05:46,456
- Um, we should get ready.
- Yeah.

228
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:48,375
- [Nicole] We're the Beatles.
- Come on, Charlie.

229
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:49,960
I didn't really get a costume together.

230
02:05:50,043 --> 02:05:52,254
- You could be George Martin.
- I don't need to be anything.

231
02:05:52,337 --> 02:05:54,589
- You've got to be something.
- A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

232
02:05:54,673 --> 02:05:56,800
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

233
02:05:56,883 --> 02:05:59,761
And we should leave soon. I'm saying that
as much for me as anyone else.

234
02:05:59,845 --> 02:06:02,347
- [Sandra] Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

235
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:03,932
[Carter] You're George. Nicole is John.

236
02:06:04,015 --> 02:06:05,559
[doors close]

237
02:06:10,856 --> 02:06:13,734
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

238
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,821
I'm going to direct two plays
in rep at REDCAT.

239
02:06:19,865 --> 02:06:20,699
Oh.

240
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:23,452
So, I'm going to be here for a while.

241
02:06:26,413 --> 02:06:27,372
That's great.

242
02:06:30,667 --> 02:06:31,877
Are you okay?

243
02:06:34,087 --> 02:06:34,921
Yeah.

244
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:39,050
It's only good.

245
02:06:39,134 --> 02:06:40,552
- [door opens]
- [Sandra] Nicole?

246
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,679
Can you help me with my zipper?

247
02:06:50,729 --> 02:06:51,563
[door closes]

248
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:06,328
[Henry] "Charlie is... in... or... -"

249
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:07,287
...something.

250
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:08,246
"...neat

251
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:12,083
and I re-ly on him

252
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:17,005
to keep things in or-der.

253
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:19,758
He is energy con..."

254
02:07:21,009 --> 02:07:24,221
- I don't know what this word is.
- You're getting so good at reading.

255
02:07:24,888 --> 02:07:26,014
What is that?

256
02:07:27,974 --> 02:07:32,521
"He doesn't look in the mirror too of-ten.

257
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:35,106
He cries eas-ily

258
02:07:35,565 --> 02:07:37,442
in movies...

259
02:07:38,652 --> 02:07:41,279
He is very self-suf -"

260
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:43,240
Self-sufficient.

261
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:47,869
"He can dar-n a sock..."

262
02:07:47,953 --> 02:07:50,497
That means sew, like a hole.

263
02:07:51,122 --> 02:07:54,125
"...and cook himself dinner

264
02:07:54,584 --> 02:07:57,462
and ir..."

265
02:07:57,546 --> 02:07:58,922
Break it into two parts.

266
02:07:59,297 --> 02:08:00,841
"...Ur. on.”

267
02:08:00,924 --> 02:08:02,801
Not "ur" but "ire."

268
02:08:02,884 --> 02:08:03,969
Ire. On.

269
02:08:04,052 --> 02:08:05,053
Iron.

270
02:08:06,888 --> 02:08:08,098
"...a shirt.

271
02:08:13,562 --> 02:08:16,022
which I fell...

272
02:08:17,357 --> 02:08:20,694
feel like I always do.

273
02:08:21,736 --> 02:08:25,115
Charlie takes all of my moods stead-ily.

274
02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:27,909
He doesn't give in to them

275
02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:30,662
or make me feel bad about them.

276
02:08:31,538 --> 02:08:33,874
He's a great dress-er
and never looks em..."

277
02:08:34,374 --> 02:08:36,459
- I don't know this one.
- Embarrassing.

278
02:08:37,294 --> 02:08:38,253
"...embarrassing,

279
02:08:43,091 --> 02:08:44,134
You read it now.

280
02:08:46,428 --> 02:08:47,846
"He's very competitive.

281
02:08:48,972 --> 02:08:50,682
He loves being a dad.

282
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:54,102
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

283
02:08:54,519 --> 02:08:55,937
like the tantrums,

284
02:08:56,438 --> 02:08:57,856
the waking up at night.

285
02:08:58,565 --> 02:09:01,026
It's almost annoying how much he likes it,

286
02:09:01,401 --> 02:09:02,777
but then, it's mostly nice.

287
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:06,114
He disappears into his own world.

288
02:09:06,197 --> 02:09:08,283
He and Henry are alike that way.

289
02:09:09,784 --> 02:09:10,994
He can tell...

290
02:09:11,328 --> 02:09:14,122
people they have food in their teeth

291
02:09:14,789 --> 02:09:17,709
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

292
02:09:18,627 --> 02:09:20,003
Charlie is self-made.

293
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:22,797
His parents, I only met them once,

294
02:09:22,881 --> 02:09:25,717
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

295
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,010
[mumbling]

296
02:09:29,387 --> 02:09:31,890
He moved to New York from Indiana

297
02:09:32,432 --> 02:09:33,350
with no safety net,

298
02:09:33,433 --> 02:09:36,394
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

299
02:09:37,187 --> 02:09:40,190
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

300
02:09:40,565 --> 02:09:41,942
With the theater company...

301
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:44,319
he casts a spell...

302
02:09:44,945 --> 02:09:47,530
that made everyone feel included.

303
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:50,825
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

304
02:09:51,993 --> 02:09:53,370
What's an intern?

305
02:09:53,453 --> 02:09:55,080
Uh, it's like a...

306
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:57,457
helper, but who isn't paid.

307
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:59,125
Why aren't they paid?

308
02:10:00,001 --> 02:10:02,003
They're young, they're learning.

309
02:10:03,213 --> 02:10:06,216
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

310
02:10:06,299 --> 02:10:07,926
Okay, keep going.

311
02:10:08,927 --> 02:10:12,931
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,

312
02:10:13,014 --> 02:10:16,434
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

313
02:10:17,018 --> 02:10:20,146
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

314
02:10:43,753 --> 02:10:45,714
And I'll never stop loving him,

315
02:10:45,797 --> 02:10:47,841
even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

316
02:10:56,224 --> 02:10:58,393
[chattering indistinctly]

317
02:11:02,105 --> 02:11:04,482
- See you. Good seeing you.
- Good seeing you too.

318
02:11:04,566 --> 02:11:06,359
- Oh, Charlie!
- G-ma.

319
02:11:06,443 --> 02:11:08,570
I'm so happy you came.

320
02:11:08,653 --> 02:11:10,155
I'll e-mail you that article.

321
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:11,364
- Yes, please do.
- Yeah.

322
02:11:11,448 --> 02:11:13,366
- [Charlie] All right. Thank you.
- [Carter] Take care.

323
02:11:17,746 --> 02:11:20,665
We were going to bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

324
02:11:20,749 --> 02:11:22,208
You want to take him?

325
02:11:23,293 --> 02:11:25,295
- It's your night.
- I know.

326
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,422
- Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.
- Good.

327
02:11:27,505 --> 02:11:29,507
Yeah, text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

328
02:11:29,591 --> 02:11:31,426
You're going to go with your dad, okay?

329
02:11:31,509 --> 02:11:32,969
- Okay.
- [Nicole] Yeah?

330
02:11:43,813 --> 02:11:45,732
[smooches] I love you.

331
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:47,484
[Henry] I love you too.

332
02:11:53,114 --> 02:11:54,032
Oh, hey.

333
02:12:06,127 --> 02:12:07,170
Thanks.
