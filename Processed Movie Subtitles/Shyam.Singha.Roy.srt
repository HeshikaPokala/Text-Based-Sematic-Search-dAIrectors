1
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:10,625
This film is dedicated to you.

2
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,625
SHYAM SINGHA ROY

3
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,625
Don't worry. He just likes to bluster.

4
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,666
Just chill. I'll take care of it.

5
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,500
Okay. Get everything ready.
I'll be right there.

6
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,208
AAKALI RAJYAM

7
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,583
IRUVAR

8
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,916
-Good morning.
-Morning, bro.

9
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,666
-Everyone is here? All set?
-Yes, we are ready.

10
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,250
-Do they have the script?
-Yes.

11
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,250
-Have you explained the scene?
-Yes, I've explained.

12
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,333
Everyone had coffee as well.

13
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,625
Thank you for reminding.
Get me some black coffee.

14
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,958
What are you looking at?
Go and get me some coffee.

15
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:05,458
-Get into position.
-Yeah, bro.

16
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:10,125
Hey, what the hell are you doing here?
Don't you have any work to do?

17
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,708
I've been promised a role in the film.

18
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,833
Oh, is it? So that's why you have
groomed yourself like a hero?

19
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,083
You fool! They will put you far away
in the background somewhere.

20
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,916
You'll regret if you take
a filmmaker's words for granted.

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,250
Go and get some black coffee.

22
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,625
Leave this here.

23
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:33,875
If you take two months to complete
the auditions for a short film,

24
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,291
how long would you take
to complete a feature film?

25
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,041
Whatever we do, it must be perfect.

26
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,833
-You're right.
-Pan it to the right.

27
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,583
This is not perfection.
This is called obsession.

28
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,958
By the time you become a director,
you'll surely make me close down my cafe.

29
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,958
Then, I'll have to open a small tea shop
near a film studio.

30
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,583
-That is your plan, right?
-Bro.

31
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,625
More than a 100 people
have come to your cafe for auditions.

32
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,000
We are promoting your brand for free.

33
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,916
What is the name of my cafe?

34
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,875
Coffin!

35
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,750
Coffin? What the heck?

36
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,916
It's Coffee Inn!

37
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,375
-Coffee. Inn.
-Okay.

38
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,333
-Coffin is a box for burying a corpse.
-Okay.

39
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,708
-Okay. Ready. Ask them to come.
-Yes, bro.

40
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,416
Hello.

41
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
-Did you read the script?
-Yes.

42
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,083
-Any doubts?
-No.

43
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,375
Ready. Start camera.

44
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,875
Rolling, bro.

45
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,875
Action!

46
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,166
The dialogue is correct.
Now, will you please act it out?

47
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,916
I did act it out.

48
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,541
It's very bland. There's no feeling in it.

49
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,375
Don't mug up the dialogues.
Keep them in your subconscious mind.

50
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,083
Action!

51
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,875
Have you worked as a news anchor?

52
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:04,833
Yes. How do you know?

53
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,458
We have seen you on TV.

54
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,125
That is not the dialogue!

55
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,583
Read it once again,
and deliver it correctly. Okay?

56
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,250
Actually,
I have worked in many short films.

57
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,333
Also, I was a TikTok star
prior to its ban.

58
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,666
I have never auditioned before.
I can directly come to the shoot.

59
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,375
Is this necessary?

60
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:37,708
You are more focused on your make-up
than your performance.

61
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,583
You may leave now.

62
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,250
Good. I like it.

63
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,208
Give me some time.
My team will contact you soon.

64
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,583
Hey, that girl is good.
Why don't you cast her?

65
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,416
She is good, but she isn't the perfect fit
for the character.

66
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,458
-She is too cliche.
-This is too much.

67
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,125
She's fair-skinned and tall.

68
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,791
Her dialogue delivery is good.
What else do you want?

69
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:14,791
To become an actor or actress,

70
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,875
it's not necessary
that one must be fair or tall.

71
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:19,875
Then?

72
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,791
Body movements. Fine speech.

73
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,375
Purity. Fine expression.

74
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,208
What do you mean by expression?

75
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,500
Body language.

76
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,916
Yeah, yesterday's party was crazy,
but I left early.

77
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh yeah! You know what happened?

78
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,583
Yesterday, when we were going back home...

79
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,208
That's the body language.

80
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,208
Hey.

81
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:11,250
So, exactly after she said that,
we laughed about it.

82
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,375
Yeah.

83
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,916
Good body movements.

84
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,500
The music was great, right?

85
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,916
No, no. She is a drama queen.

86
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,833
Yeah. Later, she started crying
in the cab.

87
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,916
You should have seen the face
of the cab driver. Oh, my God!

88
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,833
He was literally pleading with her.

89
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,208
He was so frightened.

90
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,166
Fine speech.

91
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,208
-Hey, bro!
-Hey!

92
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,291
-Sorry, ma'am.
-Please be careful.

93
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,375
-Relax. Chill.
-Sorry, ma'am.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,541
Don't panic. Here you go.

95
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:50,833
-Okay?
-Sorry, ma'am.

96
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,791
That's okay.

97
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,791
Purity.

98
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,958
Oh! Okay.

99
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,333
I got to go.
I'll catch up with you guys later.

100
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,333
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

101
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,708
She's my female lead.

102
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:19,833
Excuse me.

103
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:23,000
Hi! Can I have a word with you?
I'm Vasu, a film director.

104
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,750
-Director?
-Yeah.

105
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,250
What movies have you directed?

106
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,041
Tell her.

107
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,666
Upcoming director.

108
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,416
I'm directing a short film now.

109
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,833
If it's successful,
I'll be offered a movie.

110
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:37,541
Okay.

111
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,916
Nice, I guess. Good luck.

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,750
I think it will be great
if you could act in my film.

113
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh! Thanks.

114
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,666
But me? Acting in a film?

115
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,875
No way. I'm not interested.

116
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,000
Sorry.

117
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,583
You'll become interested
once you start working.

118
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,041
I've been holding
the auditions for two months.

119
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,541
You are exactly as I imagined
that character.

120
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,166
No... You don't understand.

121
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,333
I'm not at all interested,
so let's leave it here. Okay?

122
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,750
I need to go. Bye.

123
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,750
She is not interested.

124
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,291
-Talk to her.
-Hello!

125
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,500
It's really hard to find
a Telugu-speaking heroine.

126
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,750
Please accept the role.

127
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,833
You can get free coffee here.
This is my cafe.

128
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,708
Bro, relax.

129
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:22,541
First of all, I don't like movies.
I don't even watch them.

130
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,541
Exactly.

131
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,291
My heroine is also not interested
in movies.

132
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,416
Her physical appearance
is similar to yours.

133
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,416
Big eyes, arrogant attitude,
and average looks.

134
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,208
What the hell!

135
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,375
-I mean...
-I'm not interested, and I'm not doing it.

136
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,500
-Say something, man.
-That's it!

137
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,583
Listen...

138
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,750
Come on, man!

139
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,708
I need to take care of my cafe.

140
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,333
Then I'll continue the auditions
at your place.

141
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,750
Let's go and persuade her.

142
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,750
Hey, what the hell!

143
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,708
What do you think of yourselves?
Don't you get it?

144
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,208
You followed me to my house.
Are you crazy?

145
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,208
This is too much, man. How dare you?

146
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,125
Hey... Relax.

147
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,791
This is not right. I understand.

148
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,666
We've come here
because we're serious about casting you.

149
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,791
We are working hard. Please don't refuse.

150
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,166
What is this ruckus? Who are they?

151
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,833
Dad, they have followed me
all the way from a cafe.

152
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,291
He is trying to persuade me
despite my rejection.

153
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,416
I'll call the she-team.

154
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,750
Hey...

155
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:41,958
You look like a decent guy.
What do you do?

156
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:43,750
Film director.

157
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,416
Film director? What movies have you made?

158
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,000
It's okay.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,958
Upcoming director.

160
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:55,708
Oh! But I don't want to marry
my daughter off to a movie man.

161
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,583
Sorry, you can find someone else.

162
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,750
I know, people don't even want to rent out
their houses to movie people.

163
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,500
-Your daughter...
-Name is Keerti.

164
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,541
I'm asking Keerti to act in my short film.

165
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:07,958
Short film?
Will you release it on YouTube?

166
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,375
-I just want to show it to a producer...
-It'll be on YouTube.

167
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:15,083
-Your daughter can be part of it.
-Is it? What other films has he made?

168
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,333
Ms. Keerti, listen to me.

169
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,791
Your dad has approved.
Now you must agree to it.

170
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,458
Why should I?

171
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,125
This is my last option.
I don't have any other choice.

172
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,833
If you don't agree,
I'll tell your dad that you smoke.

173
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,250
What the hell?

174
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,458
My dad won't believe you.

175
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,208
Are you for real?

176
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,875
Please, Keerti. I'll delete it.

177
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,500
Please understand my desperation.

178
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,625
I'm really sorry for troubling you.
This is really important for me.

179
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,333
This short film is very crucial
to my career.

180
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,458
And I can't afford to hire
professional actors.

181
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,291
Films have been my passion
since childhood.

182
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,125
My budget is low.

183
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,791
I've resigned my software job as well.

184
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,666
Please understand.

185
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,750
But I don't know how to act.

186
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,916
Acting is nothing but reacting.

187
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,708
Your reactions are naturally good.

188
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,500
You are a natural star.

189
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,875
It's just a short film, dear.

190
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,041
Everyone is making them these days.

191
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,083
Our neighbor uploads all her recipes
on YouTube.

192
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,083
I secretly follow her channel.

193
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,750
Is he stalking that lady?

194
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,291
I get to see you on screen
when you're away.

195
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,666
Please accept.

196
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,375
Okay, I'll do it. But I'll leave Hyderabad
in two weeks.

197
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:40,125
-I'm going to Mumbai for higher studies.
-All the best.

198
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,708
She is pursuing
her master's in psychology.

199
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,791
Is that why she behaves like a psycho?

200
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,708
So I can give you only two weeks.
I've even booked my flight tickets.

201
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,916
Two weeks is more than enough.

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,166
And one more thing.

203
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,791
If anything troubles me during the shoot,

204
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,166
-I'll immediately opt out of it.
-No...

205
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,458
Don't worry. We'll take great care of you.
You'll not be troubled in the slightest.

206
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,583
And...

207
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,500
What about that photo?

208
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,666
Deleted. Deleted.

209
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,666
I'll pick you up at 6 am.

210
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
What photo is that?

211
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,166
Photo... Selfie!

212
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,125
Uncle, let's take a selfie. Please.

213
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,375
Hello.

214
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,125
What?

215
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,708
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

216
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,541
Oh, my God!

217
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Do you have a make-up artist?

218
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,125
Where is the make-up artist?

219
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,291
What make-up artist?

220
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,500
That guy...

221
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,125
Oh! He died of CoVID 19.

222
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,333
Please do your own make-up.

223
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,625
Make-up is set.

224
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,916
The story is...

225
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,750
She loves to paint from childhood.
Canvas is her world.

226
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,333
But her painting lacks soul.

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,166
She searches for a color in every emotion.

228
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,750
All of a sudden,
she finds a blank paper one day.

229
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
This take is okay.

230
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,041
Continue... Okay.

231
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,958
Nice. You are doing great.

232
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,708
Shall we go for the next scene?
Change your costume.

233
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,875
Ready.

234
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,375
Hey, where shall I change my dress?

235
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,041
Well, you can use my car.

236
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,125
I'll cover the car with a black cloth.

237
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,291
What the hell?

238
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,416
I don't even use
the fitting rooms at a clothes store.

239
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,375
And you are asking me to change
my dress on a highway? Impossible!

240
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,666
Keerti, films have been my passion
since childhood.

241
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,291
My budget is low.
I've even resigned my job.

242
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:29,416
Please understand.

243
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,000
What are you looking at?

244
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,500
Bro, it's about to rain.

245
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,833
Good. We can use the rain effect for free.
It costs a lot to artificially create one.

246
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,500
Will the actress agree to it?

247
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,083
Okay. Rolling!

248
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:54,541
Action!

249
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:57,500
Oh, shit.

250
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,208
Keerti... Keep walking...

251
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,375
Be in the mood!

252
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:05,666
Slowly look at the sky
and cry your heart out.

253
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,500
More. More.

254
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,958
Cut!

255
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:17,875
Nice.

256
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,791
One more!

257
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,458
The house looks great.

258
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,750
-Keep it in top angle. A nice shot.
-Okay.

259
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,708
Tell them to turn those lights off.

260
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,875
It's the police.

261
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,291
Are you shooting a film?
Do you have a permit?

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,166
-It's just a short film, sir.
-It doesn't matter.

263
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,083
We have received a complaint from the MP.

264
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,375
What's his problem with us?

265
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,708
He saw a drone flying around his house.

266
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,208
Come to the station.

267
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,708
You can take us, but leave the girl alone.

268
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,416
Oh! She is with you!

269
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,708
I thought she was related to the MP.

270
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,750
-Bhadram.
-Sir.

271
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,791
-Get her into the car.
-Okay, sir.

272
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:11,875
And then what?

273
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,500
Don't take my cap.

274
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,458
Sorry, sir.
I'll make sure this never happens again.

275
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,166
Keerti! Keerti...

276
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,833
Why should I put up
with a crazy movie guy?

277
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,625
I am a graduate in psychology.

278
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,041
Why should I get myself detained
at police stations because of you?

279
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,041
-Just go to hell.
-Okay.

280
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,125
Okay.

281
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,083
I've skipped this month's rent
to pay for the shoot.

282
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,875
I don't have enough budget
to hire a new actress.

283
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,375
It will stall the shooting of my film.

284
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,250
So be it!

285
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,250
So be it. It's all right.

286
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,791
Films have been my passion
since childhood.

287
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,416
My budget is low.
I've resigned my job as well.

288
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,083
-Please, understand. This short film--
-I understand.

289
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,000
Your career requires me to suffer.

290
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,208
Stop your theatrics. I'll do it.

291
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,500
Thank you, Keerti!

292
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,833
Thank you, uncle.

293
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,875
Thank god she's agreed to work
with me again.

294
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
Thank you. Come, let's go.

295
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,458
Such an idiot.

296
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,625
-Tomorrow is the last day of the shoot.
-Yeah, bye.

297
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:43,541
Bye.

298
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,750
-Bye.
-Bye.

299
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,083
-Hi, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

300
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,250
We've been waiting to take
a selfie with you.

301
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,708
Why?

302
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,625
Aren't you the heroine of this film?

303
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,708
Yes, I am.

304
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,666
Keshav, go back two steps.

305
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,166
-Don't be shy. Come closer.
-All right.

306
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,375
Hey, stop it!

307
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,208
-Bro...
-One second.

308
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,041
Wait for two counts, then
immediately take camera favor.

309
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,791
What are you doing?
Don't you have manners?

310
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:52,291
-Do you think I'm--
-Do you want us to buy a ticket for this?

311
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,166
Bro.

312
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:55,875
How dare you touch me?

313
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,166
Hold this.

314
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,083
Come, let's take a selfie.

315
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,750
No...

316
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:54,166
Vasu...

317
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,375
Vasu!

318
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,958
What's happening? Who are these guys?

319
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,250
-Sachin, what happened here?
-Bro...

320
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:05,000
You ear is bleeding.

321
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,500
Are you okay?

322
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:09,875
Hey, what's wrong?

323
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,458
The tripod! It cost us Rs. 15,000.
How did it break?

324
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:16,208
You acted like a hero and broke it.
First, let's get out of here.

325
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,083
VARNAM

326
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,166
-Congrats, Vasu.
-Sir.

327
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,833
Well done! Nice!
You dealt with the subject maturely.

328
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:41,833
Thank you, sir.

329
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,291
-We shall work together.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,708
Get him to sign the agreement
and pay him an advance.

331
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,208
Meet me when you have
the bound script ready.

332
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,666
I'll get it done within a month.

333
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,500
-Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

334
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,958
It's almost done, sir.
I'll give it to you tomorrow morning.

335
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,958
Okay, sir.

336
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:39,250
TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE

337
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,166
Amazing.

338
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:11,791
It's a great script, Vasu.

339
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:17,041
The climax is just mind-blowing.
I can put money on this.

340
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,666
Thank you, sir.

341
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,000
You are a very good writer.

342
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,708
You can start the project now.
I'll assign you a team.

343
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,916
Thank you, sir.

344
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:28,833
Here you go.

345
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,541
Let's wait a little longer.

346
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,958
Wait for what? It'll lose the chillness.

347
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,500
I'm waiting for Keerti.

348
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,000
You carry on.

349
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,375
Hi, Keerti.

350
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,833
Wow!

351
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,375
So excited to meet her?

352
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:46,500
You...

353
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:53,833
Hi, Keerti.

354
00:28:54,708 --> 00:28:56,208
Are you pulling my leg again?

355
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,583
-Hi.
-Hi.

356
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,041
Nice view.

357
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:16,791
What is in that bag?
Did you bring some snacks?

358
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,625
A small gift for you.

359
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:21,208
For me? It's not really necessary.

360
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:23,833
Congratulations.

361
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:25,750
Thank you.

362
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,916
I'm really happy for you.

363
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:30,583
It's very nice.

364
00:29:56,208 --> 00:30:00,708
Vasu, mention a special thanks to me
in the credits of your feature film.

365
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,041
I'll be your lucky charm.

366
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,125
Not just my name, but also add my photo.

367
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,333
Photo is added if the person is dead.
Shall I do it?

368
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,541
No need.

369
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,291
You guys are unbelievable.

370
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:20,875
I despised you guys in the beginning,
but now I'll miss you all.

371
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,041
Please be in touch.

372
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,541
You will leave for Mumbai.

373
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:30,541
This guy will ignore us
once he starts working on his new film.

374
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:32,416
I'll be all alone, selling coffee.

375
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,833
Stop your theatrics.

376
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,708
He will surely forget me.

377
00:30:35,916 --> 00:30:37,375
Do you think I'll forget you?

378
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,750
Impossible.

379
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:41,833
In that case,
wear the shirt that I've just gifted you

380
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,541
when you succeed as a director.

381
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,000
Then I will believe
that you still remember me.

382
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,916
Done.

383
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,958
Okay. I'll leave.

384
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:52,541
Hey, kid. Come, let's go.

385
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,666
-Bye.
-See you. Bye. Nice.

386
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:56,416
How long will you stay here?

387
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,541
I'll leave in another five minutes.

388
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,541
Cool.

389
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,916
Keerti, tell your friends
to keep visiting my cafe.

390
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,166
-I'll give them a ten percent discount.
-Okay.

391
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,125
-See you.
-Don't roam around, go home.

392
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,166
To your home!

393
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,750
Okay. It's about to rain. Get inside.

394
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,166
So?

395
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,541
When will we meet again?

396
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,541
I don't know.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,833
Sorry.

398
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,333
I didn't get you a gift.

399
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,875
Bye.

400
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,083
Rosie.

401
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:06,708
What the fuck!

402
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,166
-What happened?
-Who is Rosie?

403
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,041
I thought you were a gentleman.

404
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,125
Such a pervert!

405
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,250
Keerti, what's wrong?

406
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:19,958
How can you think about another girl
when you are sharing a bed with me?

407
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,250
You should be ashamed!

408
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,125
This is the psychology of men.

409
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:27,791
You can never truly love one girl.

410
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,666
You men are dogs.

411
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,083
Keerti...

412
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,541
I'm really sorry.

413
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:34,708
Rosie?

414
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,041
I don't know any Rosie.

415
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,166
It's just a slip of the tongue.

416
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:42,750
Just shut up and get lost.

417
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:45,958
It was stupid of me
to fall in love with you.

418
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,916
This is so embarrassing.

419
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,541
I never want to see your face again.

420
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,583
Rosie?

421
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:20,791
Who is Rosie?

422
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,833
I don't know.

423
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,333
Tell me the truth.

424
00:34:23,791 --> 00:34:26,375
It's the truth.
I've never heard that name...

425
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:28,750
-Rosie.
-I've never heard it before.

426
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,916
-Then why did you say call her Rosie?
-I don't know.

427
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,458
You must have picked that name
from some shitty Hollywood film.

428
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,166
And you called her by that name.

429
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:38,958
She won't take it easy.

430
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:40,708
Shit!

431
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:41,875
What do I do now?

432
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:45,875
After years of struggle, you've got
an opportunity to make a feature film.

433
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,791
Concentrate on that.

434
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,166
Rolling!

435
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,208
Action!

436
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,708
Silence!

437
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:42,833
UNIKI

438
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,291
Are you nervous?

439
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,083
That's a small word
to describe my feelings now.

440
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,958
I don't even know how to describe it.

441
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,791
It's a ten-year dream,
and one whole year of hard work.

442
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,166
Bro, the show has just ended.

443
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:17,625
Bro, how do you like the movie?

444
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,666
It's great. I loved it. A blockbuster!

445
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,541
The movie is a hit! Congratulations, dude!

446
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,041
Congratulations.

447
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,875
Bro, he is the director of this film.

448
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,708
You are the director of the film!

449
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:30,916
The movie is amazing. A blockbuster.
The climax was mind-blowing!

450
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,041
Bro, can I take a selfie with you?

451
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,583
Please, let me take a selfie.

452
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,083
Okay, keep moving.

453
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,166
Slowly.

454
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,083
Please keep moving.

455
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,291
Why are you crying like a baby?

456
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:45,583
Your film is a hit.

457
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,708
Vasu, I just got a call from Mumbai.

458
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,208
Producer Vishal Chaturvedi
has seen our movie.

459
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,916
He wants to remake it in Hindi.

460
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:00,375
Wow!

461
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,166
And they want you
to direct the Hindi version as well.

462
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,875
-Are you serious? A Bollywood film?
-Bro, this is crazy!

463
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:10,375
You are one lucky guy.
You will be reaching greater heights.

464
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,500
Let's celebrate. Open the bottle!

465
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,583
MUMBAI

466
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:28,208
MUMBAI

467
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:38,708
KOLKATA

468
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:50,583
Welcome to all of you.

469
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,291
Well, I'm super excited and happy
to introduce a south Indian sensation,

470
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:57,291
Mr. Vasudev, to the Hindi cinema.

471
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,958
I must say that his last film
was a super-duper blockbuster hit.

472
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,166
Uniki.

473
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,958
UNIKI

474
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,250
Well, we are about
to make it now in Hindi.

475
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,416
Background?

476
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,791
He has no godfather in the industry.
He is a nobody.

477
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:30,500
I've got some more great news
to share with all of you.

478
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:36,166
We're gonna be making two more
very high budget films with him.

479
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:02,666
Mr. Vasudev?

480
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,458
We have an arrest warrant against you.
You have to come with us.

481
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:08,625
Arrest warrant? What?

482
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,458
Come on. Let's go.

483
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:18,791
Well, this is a shocking news for us.

484
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,333
Our company doesn't entertain
this kind of stuff.

485
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,166
I'm calling this announcement off.

486
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,541
HE COPIED FROM BENGALI,
AND NOT KOREAN OR HOLLYWOOD!

487
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:06,458
Yes, Dad.

488
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,708
Why?

489
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,000
Okay. I'll call you back.

490
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,625
DIRECTOR VASU ARRESTED DURING PRESS MEET

491
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:55,375
Bro, please tell me if you know
any good lawyers.

492
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,791
It's about the director who got arrested.

493
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,458
Yes, he is my friend.

494
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,916
No, he is a good guy.
He is framed by someone.

495
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:08,166
Okay. Please let me know
if you find any good lawyers.

496
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,750
Okay. Bye.

497
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,041
She is Padmavati, my cousin.

498
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,333
Oh.

499
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,500
Nobody in my family likes her.

500
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,500
We always fought each other.

501
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:32,500
Then why did you bring me to her?

502
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,916
She was a gold-medalist in college.

503
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,666
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Good morning.

504
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,208
I need help with the drunk driving charges
against me.

505
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,875
The breath analyzer showed 300 points.
Who drinks that much?

506
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,875
Even if the judge lets you go, I won't.

507
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:51,583
Hi, Paddu. How are you?

508
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm a bit irritated.

509
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,208
How are your parents?

510
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,250
I don't know.
I haven't met them in a long time.

511
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:01,208
I have been meaning to meet you
for a long time.

512
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,291
But I couldn't.

513
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:06,458
I know that none of my relatives want to
meet me unless they need some legal help.

514
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,666
What can I do for you?

515
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,666
As I told you, it's about
my friend, Vasu, the film director.

516
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,625
Oh! Yes. I saw it on the news.

517
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,791
He was arrested during a press meet.

518
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,625
He is your friend! So sad.

519
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,375
Yes, ma'am. You must help him out.

520
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,333
What do you do?

521
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,708
I own a cafe.

522
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,291
Do you provide a free service to
all your customers or do you charge them?

523
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,625
We charge them.

524
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:35,958
I understand.

525
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:39,000
Of course. Tell me how much you charge.
I will pay you.

526
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,500
I will.
But first, I need to meet the accused.

527
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:44,375
He is in the police station.
Let's go, please.

528
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,791
You are right.
You shouldn't meet her often.

529
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,000
Hi, Vasu. I am Padmavati, your lawyer.

530
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,916
What's happening? Why did they arrest me?

531
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,750
India's largest publication house,
SR Publishers, has lodged

532
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:10,166
a case of copyright infringement
against you.

533
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:13,750
They have alleged that your scripts
and the story of your film

534
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:16,250
have been plagiarized
from their Telugu and Bengali books.

535
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:17,250
What?

536
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,666
Nonsense.

537
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,750
I've studied your case.
I'll come to the point.

538
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:27,541
If you plead guilty to your crime
without wasting the court's time,

539
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:29,333
your punishment could be reduced.

540
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,541
Since this is not a grave crime
like murder or rape,

541
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:34,416
you can get away
with a mere six-month sentence

542
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,208
or with just a fine, if you are lucky.

543
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:38,833
I should plead guilty?

544
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,375
Who told you that I'm guilty?

545
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,541
I'm not apologizing to anyone.

546
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,416
I did not plagiarize from any book.

547
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,958
I wrote those stories.

548
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:56,958
Two years ago, I registered them
with the Telugu Writers Association.

549
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,083
I have proof.

550
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:09,041
These books were published 50 years ago.
Your stories match theirs exactly.

551
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,416
You didn't even have the sense
to change the names of the characters

552
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,833
while copying from them.

553
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,125
They are exactly the same.

554
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:20,958
Even a kid can tell
that you have copied from this book.

555
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,375
Look, I'd lose my cool if you keep saying
that I copied someone's work.

556
00:44:32,166 --> 00:44:34,750
I've never read these books.
And I don't know Bengali either.

557
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,375
One should never lie
to a doctor or lawyer.

558
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:38,916
I'm here to help you.

559
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:48,041
Are you my lawyer or the opponent's?

560
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:51,500
Why are you forcing me to plead guilty?

561
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,708
I didn't plagiarize. Why don't you get it?

562
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:58,791
Hey! Keep your voice down.

563
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,333
It's not about me.

564
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:05,083
We have to prove to the court
that you didn't plagiarize.

565
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,708
As a lawyer,
it's your responsibility to prove it.

566
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:12,833
There's nothing to prove.
The evidence is against you.

567
00:45:12,916 --> 00:45:15,708
Quit if you can't do it.
I'll get another lawyer.

568
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,541
Okay. Good luck.

569
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:28,416
Okay. Fuck off! What the...

570
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,916
I can't deal with him.
Hire another lawyer.

571
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,958
-He's too adamant.
-What happened?

572
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,250
It's a simple open and shut case.

573
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,833
I can't help him if he doesn't cooperate.

574
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:44,250
He's really important to me.
Please don't give up on him.

575
00:45:57,291 --> 00:45:59,416
Really? What is he to you?

576
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,708
Your boyfriend?

577
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,166
It's a long story.

578
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:03,708
Okay. None of my business.

579
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:07,500
Well, I can get a bail order for him.
But I can't take up this case.

580
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:10,333
His opponent's lawyer
is Mr. Krishnamurthy.

581
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:14,708
To go up against him is nothing less
than hitting a dead wall. Impossible.

582
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:16,791
You know, I have his photo in my office.

583
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,791
Why?

584
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,208
He is my inspiration.
I aspire to become a lawyer like him.

585
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:26,416
If you want to become as great as him,
you have to beat a lawyer of his stature.

586
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,500
Now you have that opportunity.
Please think about it.

587
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,000
"Copyright case OS no. 234 of 2021,"

588
00:46:40,083 --> 00:46:43,458
"complainant SR Publishers
accused on Vasudev Ghanta."

589
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,333
Yes, proceed.

590
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,791
Your Honor, my client, SR Publishers,

591
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,333
is a leading publishing house
in the country.

592
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:58,708
They have contributed a lot
to the growth of literature

593
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,750
in our country, Your Honor.

594
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:03,916
Now, coming to the point,
the issue here is,

595
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,666
this man here, named Vasudev

596
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,916
plagiarized from Astitva,
which is my client's intellectual property

597
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,250
and a best-selling novel.

598
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,708
The accused converted it into a script,
and made a movie out of it.

599
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,708
That is not all, Your Honor.

600
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:23,375
He has plagiarized two more books,
converted them into scripts,

601
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,875
and sold them
to a Bollywood production house.

602
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,375
Mr. Vasudev did that.

603
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,875
These stories were authored
by a legendary Bengali-Telugu writer,

604
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:36,416
who shook the entire nation
and the government alike

605
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
with his writings in the 1970s.

606
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,083
His name is Shyam Singha Roy.

607
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,083
I'm submitting to the court

608
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,875
the copies of the original novel
and the plagiarized script by Mr. Vasudev.

609
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,416
Please.

610
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:56,333
WHERE THERE IS DHARMA,
THERE WILL BE VICTORY

611
00:47:56,416 --> 00:47:57,458
UNIKI

612
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,666
ASTITVA

613
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,041
Your Honor, it's a color-able imitation
of the original

614
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,458
with the sole purpose of deriving profits.

615
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:05,708
It's a direct infringement of three novels

616
00:48:05,791 --> 00:48:08,875
which are copyright properties
of my client, SR Publishers.

617
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:10,916
So now, on behalf of my client,

618
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,250
under section 63
of the copyright act 1957,

619
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:17,791
I hereby demand that Mr. Vasu
be sentenced to five years of imprisonment

620
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,625
and a penalty of Rs. 10 crores
be levied upon him.

621
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:24,041
Also, a 50 percent share in the revenue
generated by the plagiarized film

622
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,333
should be granted to my client.

623
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:30,958
That'll be all for now, Your Honor.
Thank you so much.

624
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:42,750
Defense.

625
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,666
You may put forward your case.

626
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,916
-Plead guilty.
-Impossible.

627
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,583
Your Honor, this is a false accusation.

628
00:48:51,958 --> 00:48:53,958
My client doesn't accept this accusation.

629
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,375
We plead not guilty.

630
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,875
My client is innocent until proven guilty.

631
00:48:58,416 --> 00:49:01,375
The court has verified
the copies of both the works.

632
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,833
98 percent of the content
is exactly the same.

633
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:06,291
How could he have written it
without plagiarizing?

634
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:08,291
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

635
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:12,250
The prima facie evidence is sufficient
for the court to believe that he's guilty.

636
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:14,666
Then how do you defend
and prove your innocence?

637
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,791
I don't know
why both the works are the same.

638
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,958
But I can tell you this,
I didn't copy my stories from any book.

639
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,541
My stories are my creation.

640
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,291
You can conduct a lie detection test
if you want.

641
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:29,250
What? This is not a movie. Lie detection
tests are not approved just like that.

642
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,791
-What do you...
-Your Honor...

643
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,250
Let's do that.

644
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,541
It will save everyone's time.

645
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,791
Let's go ahead
with the lie detection test.

646
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,666
Defense?

647
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,916
That is the request from the defense, sir.

648
00:49:43,333 --> 00:49:44,208
Okay.

649
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:47,458
According to the section 45,
selection of evidence,

650
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:50,583
the court authorizes
the forensic department

651
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,958
to conduct a lie detection test
on Mr. Vasudev.

652
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,125
The forensic department has concluded
that Mr. Vasudev is not lying.

653
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:36,166
Your Honor, the lie detection test
can only be considered

654
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,375
as corroborative evidence
but not as complete evidence.

655
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:42,208
I'm sure the defense
is well aware about this.

656
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,791
It is not impossible
to cheat the lie detection test.

657
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:49,791
The accused is yet
to prove himself innocent.

658
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:53,000
Until then, the charges against
Mr. Vasudev will remain valid.

659
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,291
That's all, Your Honor.

660
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,875
Your Honor, we need more time
to prove my client's innocence.

661
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:00,041
To look deep into the issue
and gather more evidence.

662
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:03,000
I also request for an unconditional bail
for my client.

663
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:05,666
Your Honor,
I object to the unconditional bail.

664
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:07,125
Overruled.

665
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:12,375
The court grants
unconditional bail to Mr. Vasudev

666
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:17,000
and also grants a period of three days
to the defense to submit further evidence.

667
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:19,375
Until then, the court is adjourned.

668
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,041
How are you?

669
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:42,791
I'm fine.

670
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,416
This shirt looks good on you.

671
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,083
I got arrested after wearing it.

672
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:04,208
But...

673
00:52:05,083 --> 00:52:06,208
Thank you.

674
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:09,875
I am the one who got you bail.
You should be thanking me.

675
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:12,791
First, you need to trust me.
Then, I'll thank you.

676
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,250
How can I trust you?

677
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,875
Your work exactly matches
the content of those books.

678
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:19,750
I don't get it either.

679
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:23,541
How can they be so similar?

680
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:27,750
Give me those books.

681
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:37,375
Shyam Singha Roy.

682
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,750
I think the 'SR' in SR Publishers
stands for Singha Roy.

683
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:44,375
I have studied this family.

684
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,958
Shyam's mother was a Telugu,
and father a Bengali.

685
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:53,000
Theirs was a love marriage.
They settled in West Bengal.

686
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:57,000
Shyam had three siblings
and he was the youngest.

687
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:01,500
He was born in a village called Kalikapur
in the Kharagpur district of West Bengal.

688
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:05,625
He became a famous writer
and a renowned social activist in Kolkata.

689
00:53:06,208 --> 00:53:07,833
Post the year 1977,

690
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:10,791
there is no information available
on his whereabouts.

691
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,083
If he is assumed dead,
no one knows where his grave is.

692
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:20,625
In 1985, his three brothers
met with a tragic car accident.

693
00:53:21,208 --> 00:53:25,291
The children of those dead brothers
are currently running the company.

694
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:27,041
They filed the case against you.

695
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,666
There are no photos of Shyam
except for the paintings in these books.

696
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:43,833
Since his mother was a Telugu,
Shyam was well-versed in Telugu as well.

697
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:45,625
He wrote books in Telugu too.

698
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,375
TRAITOR

699
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:07,125
NAXALBARI

700
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:21,125
TO MY BELOVED GOPAL

701
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,708
Keri, a 10-year-old girl, was
donated by her father to a temple.

702
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:32,416
"Her father donated her"

703
00:54:34,958 --> 00:54:40,958
"to a temple."

704
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:44,958
Vasu.

705
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,750
Your ear is bleeding again.

706
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,666
Why is he bleeding?

707
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,791
Sometimes he gets zoned out.

708
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:01,833
And he forgets his surroundings.

709
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,708
Whenever that happens,
he bleeds from his ear.

710
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:08,208
How many times has it happened before?

711
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,041
Many times.

712
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,083
It happened on the day when we fought.

713
00:55:18,708 --> 00:55:20,083
Once while writing this script.

714
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:26,750
While shooting the short film.

715
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,416
And a few more times.

716
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,208
We even consulted a doctor.

717
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:34,666
He did some tests and said
that it was the result of stress.

718
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:38,541
He was working on his first film.
He never slept properly the whole time.

719
00:55:41,916 --> 00:55:42,833
Strange.

720
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:46,000
Yes, ma'am. I really think
something is wrong with him.

721
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,500
What do you think?

722
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:51,875
A human mind is as mysterious

723
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,291
as the whole universe.

724
00:55:55,708 --> 00:56:00,125
Nobody knows the infinite secrets
that are hidden within.

725
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:03,625
Human consciousness
is an ocean full of secrets.

726
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:07,458
How do you propose we unearth
the secrets of Vasu's mind?

727
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,666
We can try clinical hypnosis on him.

728
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:12,791
Hypnosis?

729
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:15,125
Yeah. With hypnotherapy,

730
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:18,333
there is a chance to know what happens
inside Vasu's brain

731
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,666
during those blackouts.

732
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,375
Okay, ma'am. One final request.

733
00:56:24,416 --> 00:56:26,166
This is a sensitive case.

734
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:28,666
So I urge you to deal
with this matter personally.

735
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,666
Sure.

736
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,958
Our print sales are declined by 23...

737
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,125
Excuse us.

738
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:38,583
He is out on bail.

739
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,458
Also, he passed the lie detection test.

740
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,250
Uncle!

741
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,916
Is it Shyam's story?

742
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:02,458
Yes, Uncle.

743
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:16,833
Sit.

744
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,583
Hi, Vasu.

745
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,000
From our conversation,

746
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:43,041
I have noted down the dates
when you experienced those blackouts.

747
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,833
Vasu, I'm going to start
the procedure now.

748
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,041
Just relax.

749
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,708
Take a deep breath in.

750
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:12,250
Inhale and exhale all your worries out.

751
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,041
Follow my voice and look at the monitor.

752
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:33,083
This book is your life.

753
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,708
Do you know today's date?

754
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,208
August 17th.

755
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:52,708
Do you remember the day
when you were arrested?

756
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:55,833
Last Thursday.

757
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,791
When was your film released?

758
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:07,708
July 7th.

759
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,250
Vasu.

760
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:21,500
Vasu.

761
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,333
Let's go a little back.

762
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:42,958
Do you remember the date
when you finished your script?

763
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,166
October 19th.

764
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,583
Vasu, what happened on that day?

765
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,375
I had to submit my script the next day.

766
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:00,541
However hard I tried,
I wasn't able to write the climax.

767
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,875
I felt a severe headache.

768
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,708
I felt dizzy.

769
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:09,416
My whole body felt very heavy.

770
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:14,666
And?

771
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:23,583
Come on, Vasu. Try harder.
Try to remember.

772
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,333
What happened after that?

773
01:00:31,416 --> 01:00:32,666
What did you do?

774
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:35,791
Try hard, Vasu. You can do it.

775
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,583
Rosie.

776
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:16,791
Rosie?

777
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:30,208
Who is Rosie? How is she related to you?

778
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,625
My wife.

779
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:37,791
Vasu?

780
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,041
She's my wife.

781
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,958
Did Rosie give you these Bengali books?

782
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,833
These books were not published then.

783
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:01,833
ASTITVA - NAXALBARI

784
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:04,416
What do you mean?

785
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,666
What year are we talking about?

786
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:11,208
1969.

787
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,083
What is your name?

788
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:47,416
Shyam Singha Roy.

789
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:23,291
1969, KALIKAPUR, WEST BENGAL,
MONTH OF ASHWAYUJA, RIVER GANGES

790
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:30,833
Please give me some water.

791
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,250
Sister, give me some water.

792
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,541
Please give me some water.

793
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:41,916
What's the matter?

794
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:46,333
Why don't you go and fetch yourself
some water instead of asking everyone?

795
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:51,500
We aren't supposed to touch the well, sir.

796
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,583
Did the well forbid you?

797
01:04:56,916 --> 01:05:00,083
You can either wait for the rains,
or you can pluck up some courage.

798
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,708
Hey, Shyam!

799
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:15,083
He is a pariah.

800
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:17,333
He cannot touch the water from the well.

801
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,958
-What does that mean?
-He is beneath us.

802
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:26,250
The water comes from the ground
which is beneath our feet.

803
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:27,583
He is low caste.

804
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:29,250
Shouldn't he get thirsty then?

805
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,791
Water is not owned
by any particular caste.

806
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:37,333
He was born and raised in this village.
He belongs to this very land.

807
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,583
The same land grows the food
which your children eat.

808
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,333
He is an untouchable.

809
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:44,875
Then why are you walking
on the land that he walks on?

810
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,958
Why are you breathing the same air
that he breathes? Stop breathing!

811
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:54,541
Land, air, and water
are life-preserving resources.

812
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,708
They don't abide by the evil caste system.

813
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,541
You can't impose caste hierarchy anymore.

814
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:04,000
This isn't the age of Rigveda.
We now live in independent India.

815
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,333
An Ambedkar has arrived here!

816
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,500
You can write these ideas in your books.
Maybe we read them sometime.

817
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:13,083
If you dare touch the water,

818
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,000
we will burn down your hut,

819
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,000
and then, we'll skin you alive.

820
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:20,000
Sir, we don't want water.

821
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,208
We will go away.

822
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,208
We will go away.

823
01:06:58,166 --> 01:06:59,875
Now, this well is untouchable as well.

824
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:01,625
This belongs to him.

825
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:04,958
Those who are thirsty
can still draw water from here.

826
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:08,375
Those who want to abide by caste
can die of thirst.

827
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:16,541
Before you go near his hut,

828
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,708
do keep in mind
that I know where your house is.

829
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:23,416
Beware!

830
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,958
Very good.

831
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:34,083
Well done, comrade.

832
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,083
Friend, come and join us.

833
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:46,833
One bullet can kill only one person.

834
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:50,000
Whereas one written word can mobilize
millions of people.

835
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:16,625
"The sky is covered with clouds
and the sun has gone down."

836
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,708
"Kuku went to fetch water
from the Padma Dighi sector."

837
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:22,916
It's Padma riverbank.

838
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,458
Padma...

839
01:08:26,041 --> 01:08:27,041
Riverbank.

840
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,916
Your father taught me this song
when I was your age.

841
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,875
I'd sit on his lap and learn.

842
01:08:36,083 --> 01:08:38,833
Now it's my responsibility
to pass it on to you guys.

843
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,916
What have you done this time, Shyam?

844
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:46,041
Your brother is very angry with you.

845
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,375
What did I do?

846
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,958
Have I done something?

847
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:55,166
Dadabhai is coming back from Kharagpur.
Be careful with him.

848
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:59,416
No matter what he says to you,
don't talk back to him.

849
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:01,375
Have some of this sacred food.

850
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,166
Do not fight during the festivities.

851
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,541
What's the matter?

852
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,708
Is it about today's incident?

853
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,375
Or yesterday's incident?

854
01:09:12,416 --> 01:09:14,416
Or about the one from the day before?

855
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:21,833
Sit here.

856
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:30,291
Do you realize what you are doing?

857
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,000
You bring dishonor to our family.

858
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:37,333
You threw a Dalit into the well.
Are you out of your mind?

859
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:39,666
They will banish us from this village.

860
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:42,166
Don't worry about that, brother.

861
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:44,166
I'll leave this place.

862
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:50,916
This is a place where some humans
are treated as filth by fellow humans.

863
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,208
I can't stay here.

864
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,333
Go away.

865
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,625
Join those low-caste people
and dream of bringing a revolution.

866
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:02,166
I've heard that you're mixing
with those armed revolutionaries.

867
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:07,791
If I wanted to join them,

868
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:10,500
I could find my way
to their base in the forest.

869
01:10:13,416 --> 01:10:14,625
My principles are different.

870
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:18,125
Your principles and books
are good for nothing.

871
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:21,083
Selfishness is the hallmark of human life.

872
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:24,083
I agree. Selfishness is a great virtue.

873
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:27,166
You care for your family.
That's selfishness.

874
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:30,083
I care about the world around me.
That's my selfishness.

875
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,750
Shyam?

876
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,583
Don't be upset that he hit you.
He's our elder brother.

877
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:50,458
I am not upset with our brother.
I am upset about the society.

878
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:54,458
It's not just one village,
this problem plagues the whole country.

879
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,083
Only literature can bring about
a change in society.

880
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,500
Shyam.

881
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:01,916
I have to go. And I must write.

882
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,541
Have you packed already?

883
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,083
Don't tell anyone.

884
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:16,291
I bought the ticket for the Howrah Express
three days ago.

885
01:11:16,666 --> 01:11:20,208
Festivities are going on.
Can't you wait until it is over?

886
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:26,041
The festival will come again next year.

887
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,833
Lost time will never come back.

888
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:29,916
Anyway, I'm an atheist.

889
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,375
I'll leave at midnight
when everyone is asleep.

890
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,083
Please ask sister-in-law
to pack me some rasgullas.

891
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,166
Shyam.

892
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:25,875
Quit smoking.

893
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,083
It's empty now. I've quit it.

894
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:33,333
Be careful.
Write us a letter as soon as you reach.

895
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,416
Hey!

896
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,500
Do you know where the boatman is?

897
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,166
It's the first day
of Navaratri festivities.

898
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:05,708
He must be in the temple
along with the others.

899
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:33,333
Bro, are you looking for me?
It's getting late. Let's go.

900
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:36,666
Girls, move quickly.

901
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,875
There is a crowd behind us. Move quickly.

902
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,916
You danced very well.

903
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,125
-Move...
-Please bless my child.

904
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,583
Move it.

905
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:55,166
Girls, don't be late.

906
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:08,208
Come on.

907
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:24,750
Bro, let's go.

908
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,875
Why are they taking them inside?

909
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,750
They are devadasis
who migrated from Bangladesh.

910
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:32,708
The wives of the deity.

911
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,833
No man is supposed
to lay his eyes on them.

912
01:18:34,916 --> 01:18:36,708
They are held captive in there.

913
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:39,708
They come to the temple to dance,
and then again go back.

914
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:42,208
They offer many services inside.

915
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:45,541
They entertain and satisfy the deity
with their dance and whatnot.

916
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,500
Hey, wait!

917
01:19:02,666 --> 01:19:05,041
Look, girls. All of you get up.

918
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,583
Stand in a line.

919
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,291
Mahant is here.

920
01:19:44,708 --> 01:19:45,541
That girl.

921
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:03,125
Look here.

922
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:05,958
Get her ready soon.

923
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,166
If it's delayed, I will see to your end.

924
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,500
Faster. Move.

925
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:46,083
There are people following us.
Come on, move fast.

926
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,458
What happened?

927
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,125
Move your feet.

928
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,000
Quickly. What are you looking at?

929
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:58,416
Girls, get in quickly.

930
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,333
You dance beautifully.

931
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,708
I need to talk to you.

932
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,833
Will you come out with me?

933
01:21:12,708 --> 01:21:13,958
What's your name?

934
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,000
Hey, Maitreyi! Come, move it.

935
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:22,666
Come on, make it fast.
What are you looking at?

936
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,791
Maitreyi.

937
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,166
Come.

938
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:53,166
What's the matter?
Why aren't you asleep yet?

939
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:55,041
What are you thinking?

940
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:59,500
Shashi, do you know
what happened out there?

941
01:22:00,208 --> 01:22:02,500
A guy asked me to go out with him.

942
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:03,750
Go out?

943
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,291
I mean, to go outside the temple.

944
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:10,000
-Are you serious?
-Hush!

945
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:11,875
Yes.

946
01:22:12,416 --> 01:22:13,833
Are you going?

947
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:15,541
Going where?

948
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:18,833
You know we can't do that.

949
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,791
How dare he ask me to go out with him!

950
01:22:25,083 --> 01:22:29,000
He must have considered us normal humans.

951
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:34,666
Had I been in your place,
I would've gone away with him right then.

952
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,500
Of course, you would.

953
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:42,875
If someone listens to our conversation,
we will be punished and locked up.

954
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,083
Go to sleep.

955
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:52,500
Anyway, how can we go out with a stranger?

956
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:57,791
Higher! Higher!

957
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:02,958
Didn't you leave for Kolkata
to write your books?

958
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:07,583
What's the hurry?
Let the nine-day festivities get over.

959
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,791
Since when did you turn into a theist?

960
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,500
It's not theism.

961
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,666
It's love.

962
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:20,041
THIRD NIGHT

963
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:23,333
Thus Binodini, a devadasi,

964
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:29,291
spent her entire life in the temple

965
01:23:29,375 --> 01:23:32,500
and attained the path to heaven.

966
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:33,666
Didn't Binodini

967
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,833
ever step out of the temple threshold?

968
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:39,500
No.

969
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:42,541
Why?

970
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:45,708
It is our culture, a devadasi,
wife of a deity,

971
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,000
is not supposed to leave
the shelter of God.

972
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:50,416
Isn't this whole world a shelter of God?

973
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,000
So, what's wrong if they come out?

974
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,041
Poor Binodini!

975
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:59,333
She could never experience the beauty
of this world, which your God created.

976
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:02,041
Instead of living a 100 years as a slave,

977
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:05,375
living one day as a free human being
is more meaningful.

978
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:15,416
Everyone, come and take the sacred food.

979
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:33,750
Come to the south entrance at 10 pm.

980
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,208
I'll be waiting for you.

981
01:26:43,708 --> 01:26:45,625
I thought you must have left.

982
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:47,041
I knew you would come.

983
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,833
I don't want to go out.

984
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,916
I came here to see
if you were really waiting here.

985
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:56,375
Okay.

986
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,666
Come.

987
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,708
Maitreyi!

988
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,083
That's the name the temple gave you.

989
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,708
What's the name your parents gave you?

990
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,250
I'll have to ask them if I ever meet them.

991
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,291
How do you know Telugu?

992
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,791
The teachers from Andhra taught me
Kuchipudi dance and Telugu.

993
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:58,458
I learned Tamil along with Bharatanatyam.

994
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:00,375
I learned Malayalam
along with Mohiniyattam.

995
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:03,125
Also, I know Odiya, Assamese,
and Sanskrit too.

996
01:28:03,666 --> 01:28:05,166
Do you know how to row a boat?

997
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:08,583
No.

998
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:11,916
I'll teach you.

999
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:14,291
Hold this.

1000
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:30,875
There are two ways to do
any activity in this world.

1001
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
One, with fear.

1002
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,333
And the other...

1003
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:39,375
With love.

1004
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,958
Just like the way you dance.

1005
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,291
What do you do?

1006
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,083
I'm a writer.

1007
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:21,916
I write.

1008
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,041
What do you write?

1009
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:27,791
The things I need to tell this world.

1010
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:32,166
How will you tell this world about me?

1011
01:29:36,208 --> 01:29:37,250
Milky cheeks...

1012
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:40,583
The skin that radiates a golden glow...

1013
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:43,666
The eyes that resemble a child in fear...

1014
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,083
Flowy hair...

1015
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:49,083
The figure,
that of a finely chiseled sculpture...

1016
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:50,541
Dances like a peacock...

1017
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:53,791
A maiden who never tasted
the love of her parents...

1018
01:29:55,333 --> 01:29:57,208
Living in companionship with a rock...

1019
01:29:58,041 --> 01:30:00,583
Though the body has been violated
in the name of God,

1020
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,875
yet the heart is filled with holiness.

1021
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:14,833
It's almost dawn.

1022
01:30:15,666 --> 01:30:17,958
I have to go. Please take me back.

1023
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,041
Time just flies by while talking with you.

1024
01:30:31,791 --> 01:30:33,958
By the way, what's your name?

1025
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:36,250
Shyam.

1026
01:30:36,541 --> 01:30:37,708
Shyam Singha Roy.

1027
01:30:52,083 --> 01:30:53,916
FOURTH NIGHT

1028
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,625
FIFTH NIGHT

1029
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,208
He is Manoj Singha Roy,
my third elder brother.

1030
01:32:28,166 --> 01:32:31,291
My eldest brother is like a father figure,
whereas he is like a mother to me.

1031
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:34,083
This is my friend.

1032
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,083
Hello.

1033
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:36,375
Who are you related to?

1034
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,541
She is related to God.

1035
01:32:39,625 --> 01:32:41,416
SIXTH NIGHT

1036
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:05,125
She is...

1037
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:53,500
The glimmer in her eyes,
The shimmer on her cheeks

1038
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:22,500
Shyam...

1039
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:27,791
You're like a rose that spreads beauty
and bliss while surrounded by thorns.

1040
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,083
Today onwards your name is...

1041
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:38,500
Rosie!

1042
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:45,291
Rosie!

1043
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:15,833
NINTH NIGHT

1044
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,375
Come away with me, Rosie.

1045
01:38:28,125 --> 01:38:29,666
I come out with you every day.

1046
01:38:33,458 --> 01:38:34,416
Not like this.

1047
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:38,250
Get out of this captivity
and come into my life.

1048
01:38:39,125 --> 01:38:40,458
Come to Kolkata with me.

1049
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,625
We shall get married
and start a new life together.

1050
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:52,000
Shyam, don't forget that I am a devadasi.

1051
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:55,791
A woman is a slave to none.

1052
01:38:57,958 --> 01:39:00,625
And the one who desires enslavement
can never be God.

1053
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,333
This is human slavery
under the guise of God.

1054
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:06,291
Forget it.

1055
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,250
Tell me, are you happy?

1056
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:12,625
Do you want to live like a slave?

1057
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:18,625
There are no other festivities
in my life except these nine nights.

1058
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
Nobody wishes to lead such a life.

1059
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,750
We live it out thinking
this is what destiny has in store for us.

1060
01:39:30,291 --> 01:39:32,750
Nothing is superior to one's self-respect.

1061
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,750
There is nothing wrong in standing up
for what is right.

1062
01:39:38,416 --> 01:39:40,291
Only cowards talk about destiny.

1063
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,583
Why do you undermine your own value?

1064
01:39:42,666 --> 01:39:43,625
Ridiculous!

1065
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,166
How can I say what my worth is?

1066
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:53,500
My life was bartered for a sack of rice,
that is my worth.

1067
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,333
A sculpture in that temple
is worthier than me.

1068
01:40:01,583 --> 01:40:04,958
Your worth cannot be determined by
any one, no matter who they are.

1069
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:08,250
It is what you believe,
the belief that you have in yourself.

1070
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,875
Can I survive in the outside world?

1071
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:17,708
Will this society accept me
if I leave the temple?

1072
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,416
Tell me.

1073
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:23,458
Have you heard about MS Subbalakshmi?

1074
01:40:24,083 --> 01:40:25,375
She was a devadasi too.

1075
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:27,875
But today she is a Padma Bhushan awardee.

1076
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:31,416
Balasaraswathi,
the greatest Bharatanatyam dancer in India

1077
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:34,083
belongs to a devadasi family.

1078
01:40:34,833 --> 01:40:38,208
You have mastered
the art of classical dance.

1079
01:40:41,625 --> 01:40:44,666
I am with you, and always will be.

1080
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,375
You can have a life that you desire.

1081
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:49,833
You need not fear anyone.

1082
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,375
I'll be waiting for you.

1083
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:59,250
Across this river,
there is a world awaiting our arrival.

1084
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:16,541
VIJAYADASHAMI

1085
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:23,583
Careful, hold this. Over here.

1086
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,333
Oh, God. You are so badly injured.

1087
01:42:28,416 --> 01:42:29,541
I'm so sorry for this.

1088
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,125
Here...

1089
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,083
Careful.

1090
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:51,875
What happened?

1091
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:55,333
What happened?

1092
01:43:01,083 --> 01:43:02,041
Be careful.

1093
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:08,833
Girls, where are you?

1094
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:11,166
Come fast.

1095
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,125
Mahant is here.

1096
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:19,000
Come, stand in line.

1097
01:43:20,041 --> 01:43:21,000
Come fast.

1098
01:43:40,708 --> 01:43:41,541
That girl.

1099
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:01,541
Let go of me. I won't come.

1100
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:03,083
Leave me, I won't come.

1101
01:44:07,166 --> 01:44:08,333
I won't go.

1102
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:10,375
I don't want to go.

1103
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,375
We won't come.

1104
01:44:26,958 --> 01:44:28,041
We won't come.

1105
01:44:30,791 --> 01:44:32,291
We are wives of God.

1106
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:35,000
It means, we are like goddesses.

1107
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:39,000
We are not sculptures
that anyone can lay hands on.

1108
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:42,583
We are human beings.

1109
01:44:45,041 --> 01:44:46,416
Nobody owns us.

1110
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,208
Not even the God.

1111
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:05,916
How dare you speak against me!

1112
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:28,375
You are not a slave of God,
but you're a slave of mine.

1113
01:46:06,666 --> 01:46:09,125
Mahant's word is always final.

1114
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:53,375
Go from that side.

1115
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:55,041
Go from that side.

1116
01:46:58,916 --> 01:46:59,875
Hey! Move fast.

1117
01:47:46,375 --> 01:47:47,625
Who the hell are you?

1118
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:51,791
How dare you!

1119
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:06,625
Catch him.

1120
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,458
Don't let him get away.

1121
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:24,000
Every woman is as sacred
as a temple sanctum.

1122
01:51:24,291 --> 01:51:28,041
What should be done to the wild dog
that contaminates a temple sanctum?

1123
01:51:46,791 --> 01:51:48,708
A woman is not a slave to anyone.

1124
01:51:49,708 --> 01:51:52,666
Not even to God.

1125
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:56,000
Beware!

1126
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:29,291
Get down.

1127
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:31,166
Come on, get down.

1128
01:52:33,625 --> 01:52:34,750
DAINIK BANGLA

1129
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,583
ROYAL PRESS PROP. SAYAN SARKAR

1130
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:10,333
Yes?

1131
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:11,791
I need some work.

1132
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:20,000
I can give you a job without pay.

1133
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:23,208
But I will take care of food
and accommodation.

1134
01:53:24,166 --> 01:53:25,750
In that case, we are two people.

1135
01:53:34,375 --> 01:53:35,208
Oh.

1136
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:26,750
Grandpa asked me to give this to you.

1137
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,083
They'll be here in an hour.

1138
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:45,291
I don't know how to cook.

1139
01:54:57,083 --> 01:54:59,333
Can I have one more rasgulla?

1140
01:55:04,458 --> 01:55:06,458
-Do you want to learn to dance?
-Yes.

1141
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:30,916
You can never bear a child.

1142
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:33,833
I'm very sorry.

1143
01:56:39,041 --> 01:56:40,333
Why do you need kids?

1144
01:56:42,625 --> 01:56:43,750
Am I not enough?

1145
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:04,708
Type this and compose
the rest of the text.

1146
01:57:05,125 --> 01:57:06,291
I'll check it.

1147
01:57:06,416 --> 01:57:07,333
Sir.

1148
01:57:08,625 --> 01:57:12,666
I have written an article on the topic
that you've been working on.

1149
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:14,583
Would you like to see it once?

1150
01:57:15,625 --> 01:57:16,583
Show me.

1151
01:57:24,791 --> 01:57:26,375
What nonsense have you written?

1152
01:57:26,458 --> 01:57:28,541
You can't just write
whatever comes to your mind.

1153
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:36,333
Print this one.

1154
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,250
You are a great writer.

1155
01:57:58,833 --> 01:58:04,041
And I take full responsibility of printing
your first book.

1156
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Thank you.

1157
01:58:39,916 --> 01:58:41,916
ASTITVA

1158
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:46,291
ASTITVA

1159
01:58:51,041 --> 01:58:52,791
Hey, congratulations!

1160
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:54,583
The book became a huge success.

1161
01:59:17,375 --> 01:59:20,125
We're arresting you for writing
against the government.

1162
01:59:20,708 --> 01:59:22,666
Red salute to the revolutionaries!

1163
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:28,041
Start printing.

1164
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:05,000
Royalty checks.

1165
02:00:07,125 --> 02:00:09,625
Let's buy a piece of land
and build our own house.

1166
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:15,375
What's the matter, Rosie?

1167
02:00:15,958 --> 02:00:19,583
I was lucky to find you
and I escaped from their captivity.

1168
02:00:20,708 --> 02:00:23,416
If there were 25 devadasis
in just one temple,

1169
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,208
in temples across the nation,

1170
02:00:25,291 --> 02:00:28,250
just imagine how many devadasis
must be living under subjugation.

1171
02:00:28,333 --> 02:00:32,458
But society doesn't have
any regard for them.

1172
02:00:33,125 --> 02:00:35,291
Who will liberate them
from their struggles?

1173
02:00:35,375 --> 02:00:37,666
Who is responsible
for their children's future?

1174
02:01:02,125 --> 02:01:04,291
TRAITOR

1175
02:01:18,625 --> 02:01:22,875
In a community where a woman
sells her flesh to feed herself,

1176
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:25,291
all men from that community are impotent.

1177
02:01:26,458 --> 02:01:28,375
Women are not a commodity!

1178
02:02:22,875 --> 02:02:24,250
ASTITVA

1179
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
TO DOWN WITH SHYAM SINGHA ROY

1180
02:02:28,833 --> 02:02:30,000
I AM A FAN OF YOUR IDEAS

1181
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:51,583
Many more are coming.

1182
02:02:52,666 --> 02:02:54,458
We can't accommodate them all here.

1183
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:58,291
I'm planning to provide housing
and jobs to those who can work,

1184
02:02:59,041 --> 02:03:01,458
and a pension for those who can't work.

1185
02:03:02,666 --> 02:03:04,416
Even the government will help me in this.

1186
02:03:16,833 --> 02:03:18,208
I have no worries in my mind.

1187
02:03:20,166 --> 02:03:22,041
It is as clear as this moonless sky.

1188
02:03:26,166 --> 02:03:27,625
Is this what we call happiness?

1189
02:03:30,416 --> 02:03:32,750
Shyam, you know what?

1190
02:03:33,666 --> 02:03:37,791
It is said that a devadasi who dies on
a new moon day will be unified with God.

1191
02:03:39,458 --> 02:03:41,666
Whenever death comes knocking at my door--

1192
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:47,083
I want to die on a new moon day like this,
lying on your lap,

1193
02:03:47,666 --> 02:03:51,833
staring at you in my last moments
with a smile on my lips.

1194
02:03:54,541 --> 02:03:55,916
That's my final wish.

1195
02:04:21,166 --> 02:04:22,875
Our elder brother is unwell.

1196
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:24,583
He wants to see you.

1197
02:04:25,916 --> 02:04:27,000
Will you come home once?

1198
02:04:55,333 --> 02:04:57,791
I'm scared of that village.

1199
02:04:58,916 --> 02:05:00,791
After all that has happened there,

1200
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:04,000
I don't feel good about
you going back to that village.

1201
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:08,750
Don't go, Shyam.

1202
02:05:11,541 --> 02:05:13,083
I lost my parents in my childhood.

1203
02:05:14,250 --> 02:05:16,333
My brother has been
a father figure to me since then.

1204
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:20,958
I have to go, Rosie.

1205
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:26,416
Fear shouldn't constrain
my love for my family.

1206
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:35,583
Take care. Even if it takes a while...

1207
02:05:38,125 --> 02:05:39,291
I promise,

1208
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:41,666
I'll be back.

1209
02:06:18,958 --> 02:06:22,208
I read your books without
the knowledge of our brothers.

1210
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:24,458
I've collected all your books.

1211
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:26,875
I'm your biggest fan.

1212
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:35,791
What are you writing? Is it a new story?

1213
02:06:36,583 --> 02:06:37,750
A short story.

1214
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:39,500
I've just got the idea.

1215
02:06:45,333 --> 02:06:47,083
Read it and tell me your opinion.

1216
02:06:59,125 --> 02:07:01,500
Sister-in-law, Shyam is here!

1217
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:03,875
Everybody come here.

1218
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:07,500
How are you?

1219
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:09,708
I'm fine. How are you?

1220
02:07:09,833 --> 02:07:11,041
I'm good. Have some food.

1221
02:07:11,125 --> 02:07:12,375
Serve him food.

1222
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,416
Hurry up.

1223
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:17,541
Go and get some coconuts from the market.

1224
02:07:17,916 --> 02:07:19,833
I'll get some rasgullas as well, okay?

1225
02:07:20,416 --> 02:07:21,416
Take care of him.

1226
02:07:27,208 --> 02:07:28,250
Why is the house so silent?

1227
02:07:28,708 --> 02:07:29,750
Where are the kids?

1228
02:07:29,833 --> 02:07:32,625
They are in Kharagpur,
pursuing their studies there.

1229
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:41,416
How are you, Sister-in-law?

1230
02:07:47,916 --> 02:07:49,041
What happened?

1231
02:07:49,583 --> 02:07:50,583
Are you all right?

1232
02:07:50,958 --> 02:07:53,916
Nothing like that. Have your food, Shyam.

1233
02:07:57,708 --> 02:07:58,791
Sit.

1234
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:02,750
You may go inside.

1235
02:08:09,208 --> 02:08:10,750
How is your health, Brother?

1236
02:08:10,958 --> 02:08:11,916
Fine.

1237
02:08:13,958 --> 02:08:17,375
Everybody is talking about you.

1238
02:08:17,708 --> 02:08:20,083
I read about you
in the newspapers as well.

1239
02:08:20,458 --> 02:08:22,541
You have become a great person.

1240
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:28,875
I haven't read any of your books.

1241
02:08:29,833 --> 02:08:32,291
I don't like your thoughts anyway.

1242
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,666
But you have done well in your life,

1243
02:08:36,416 --> 02:08:37,791
that's good enough for me.

1244
02:08:39,208 --> 02:08:42,000
We can't do away with blood relationships.

1245
02:08:42,833 --> 02:08:44,250
I can't keep you away.

1246
02:08:45,416 --> 02:08:47,541
I've arranged a match for you,
from our caste.

1247
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:50,291
Meet her once, and then get married.

1248
02:08:52,375 --> 02:08:56,333
You can continue
your social service from here.

1249
02:09:07,958 --> 02:09:09,291
I'm already married, Brother.

1250
02:09:15,916 --> 02:09:19,250
If this is what you wanted to discuss,
then I'm done with it.

1251
02:09:19,541 --> 02:09:22,291
We will never accept that prostitute
as a daughter-in-law in this house.

1252
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:25,708
She's my wife.

1253
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:27,750
Rosie Singha Roy.

1254
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,583
If you speak ill of her once again,
I'd make you pay for it.

1255
02:09:31,916 --> 02:09:32,791
Beware!

1256
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:55,958
You revolted against our traditions
and left this village.

1257
02:10:56,041 --> 02:10:59,750
And because you belong to this family
and we are your siblings,

1258
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:03,458
the people here are treating us
like untouchables.

1259
02:11:07,666 --> 02:11:11,791
Only your death can guarantee
a good future for our children.

1260
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:17,958
We can regain our honor in this village
by putting you to death.

1261
02:11:47,375 --> 02:11:49,083
Shyam!

1262
02:11:49,875 --> 02:11:51,375
Shyam!

1263
02:11:51,958 --> 02:11:53,125
Shyam!

1264
02:11:56,916 --> 02:11:58,916
What did you do to him? Shyam!

1265
02:12:00,458 --> 02:12:02,875
I promised her that I would come back.

1266
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:05,833
Oh, God!

1267
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:08,500
Shyam!

1268
02:12:09,208 --> 02:12:10,958
Shyam!

1269
02:12:14,666 --> 02:12:17,041
I have made a mistake, Shyam!

1270
02:12:18,625 --> 02:12:20,041
Shyam!

1271
02:13:05,875 --> 02:13:07,166
I need to go to Kolkata.

1272
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:38,458
Who are you?

1273
02:14:41,625 --> 02:14:42,500
What do you want?

1274
02:14:42,708 --> 02:14:45,208
The press owner, Sayan Sarkar.

1275
02:14:46,083 --> 02:14:47,208
He is my grandfather.

1276
02:14:56,625 --> 02:14:57,625
Sarada?

1277
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:11,458
A dance teacher named Rosie
used to live here.

1278
02:15:13,458 --> 02:15:14,416
Rosie?

1279
02:15:16,833 --> 02:15:18,083
Our Rosie?

1280
02:15:21,583 --> 02:15:24,000
Nobody came looking for Rosie
in all these years.

1281
02:15:25,041 --> 02:15:26,500
Are you a relative of hers?

1282
02:15:29,458 --> 02:15:31,708
I'm a very close relative of hers.

1283
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:35,125
There was nobody to look after the trust.

1284
02:15:36,208 --> 02:15:37,416
Hence it was shut down.

1285
02:15:37,708 --> 02:15:39,875
Many of them
were left in a helpless situation.

1286
02:15:40,291 --> 02:15:43,375
Some of them chose to switch back
to their previous livelihood,

1287
02:15:43,708 --> 02:15:45,791
for the sake of their children.

1288
02:15:46,625 --> 02:15:51,083
A few families have managed to survive
in Sonagachi.

1289
02:15:51,166 --> 02:15:52,958
I was very small then.

1290
02:15:53,708 --> 02:15:55,416
I don't clearly remember,

1291
02:15:56,208 --> 02:15:59,125
but a few days after
her husband Shyam's disappearance,

1292
02:15:59,583 --> 02:16:01,000
Rosie too left this place,

1293
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:02,583
and went away searching for Shyam.

1294
02:16:03,166 --> 02:16:07,125
The last news was that both of them
were killed in their village.

1295
02:16:07,791 --> 02:16:10,750
Vasu, we need to be in the court tomorrow.

1296
02:16:13,791 --> 02:16:14,833
Your Honor...

1297
02:16:18,333 --> 02:16:19,916
I'm really sorry, Your Honor.

1298
02:16:20,791 --> 02:16:23,333
But in my career of close
to about 35 years,

1299
02:16:23,416 --> 02:16:27,208
I've never seen something
as preposterous or as absurd as this.

1300
02:16:28,083 --> 02:16:28,916
Rebirth!

1301
02:16:30,416 --> 02:16:33,541
Finding no other way
to disprove their crime,

1302
02:16:33,625 --> 02:16:36,458
they are presenting
such a third-rate concept in court.

1303
02:16:36,916 --> 02:16:38,375
The accused is a filmmaker, Your Honor.

1304
02:16:39,083 --> 02:16:42,625
He shot a video
and he is playing that as evidence.

1305
02:16:43,583 --> 02:16:46,750
Your Honor, this isn't the 16th century.
We are in the 21st century.

1306
02:16:46,833 --> 02:16:49,875
If we accept such videos as evidence,

1307
02:16:49,958 --> 02:16:53,208
tomorrow someone else, claiming to be
the reincarnation of Dhirubhai Ambani,

1308
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:55,500
might lay claim to the ownership
of Reliance Industries.

1309
02:16:55,791 --> 02:16:58,750
But just to humbly remind
the honorable court, Your Honor,

1310
02:16:58,833 --> 02:17:00,916
hypnotherapy is not medically approved
in India.

1311
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:02,125
-Isn't it so, professor?
-Yes, but--

1312
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:03,500
That's it.

1313
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:06,583
So, Your Honor,
I will conclude with two things.

1314
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:10,625
Hypnosis results cannot be considered
as evidence in any case.

1315
02:17:10,708 --> 02:17:13,250
And, the idea of reincarnation
is a superstition.

1316
02:17:13,416 --> 02:17:16,375
There is no scientific proof for that.
That'll be all, Your Honor.

1317
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,333
With that, I rest my case. Thank you.

1318
02:17:19,791 --> 02:17:21,083
You may leave now, ma'am.

1319
02:17:24,708 --> 02:17:25,666
Mr. Krishnamurthy...

1320
02:17:26,958 --> 02:17:29,375
What is that on your forehead?

1321
02:17:29,791 --> 02:17:31,041
That's a religious mark. So?

1322
02:17:31,125 --> 02:17:34,000
As you are a devotee of Lord Vishnu,
I don't need to remind you this.

1323
02:17:34,375 --> 02:17:37,083
When people demanded to build
a temple in Ayodhya for Lord Rama,

1324
02:17:37,166 --> 02:17:38,791
the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu,

1325
02:17:39,166 --> 02:17:44,000
the Supreme Court of India
permitted them to do so,

1326
02:17:44,125 --> 02:17:46,750
but never asked for scientific proof
for Lord Rama's existence,

1327
02:17:47,375 --> 02:17:48,958
nor did it dismiss it as superstition.

1328
02:17:52,083 --> 02:17:56,333
In 1939, a girl named Shanti Devi claimed
to be the reincarnation of Lugdibai.

1329
02:17:56,416 --> 02:17:58,208
It created a sensation across the country.

1330
02:17:58,291 --> 02:18:03,708
A 15 member committee was set up,
to find the truth behind the matter

1331
02:18:04,333 --> 02:18:07,916
by the greatest lawyer this nation
has ever produced, Mahatma Gandhi.

1332
02:18:08,250 --> 02:18:11,000
He didn't dismiss it as a superstition.

1333
02:18:12,041 --> 02:18:14,333
In fact,
according to the commission's findings,

1334
02:18:14,416 --> 02:18:16,750
Shanti Devi was indeed
a reincarnation of Lugdibai.

1335
02:18:17,208 --> 02:18:19,750
I'm submitting the photographs
and documents related to that case.

1336
02:18:25,916 --> 02:18:28,125
There was no scientific proof
in that case either.

1337
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,125
Similarly, my client is a reincarnation
of Shyam Singha Roy.

1338
02:18:34,416 --> 02:18:36,250
And he rewrote his own stories.

1339
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,833
There is no copyright violation
in this case, Your Honor.

1340
02:18:40,416 --> 02:18:43,791
Facts can be proved, but this is truth.

1341
02:18:46,166 --> 02:18:47,416
It doesn't have any proof.

1342
02:19:01,125 --> 02:19:03,916
The final judgment is adjourned
for tomorrow.

1343
02:19:21,291 --> 02:19:23,666
After hearing the arguments
from both sides,

1344
02:19:24,625 --> 02:19:28,458
due to the lack of logical
and scientific evidence

1345
02:19:30,375 --> 02:19:31,833
regarding this case...

1346
02:19:31,958 --> 02:19:33,375
Sorry, sir. A small request.

1347
02:19:38,083 --> 02:19:40,666
-Who is he?
-He is requesting to meet you.

1348
02:19:43,625 --> 02:19:44,666
Let him in.

1349
02:19:47,083 --> 02:19:50,250
Considering a personal request
from someone related to this case,

1350
02:19:50,333 --> 02:19:52,708
I hereby allow a witness
to appear in the court

1351
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:54,500
before the verdict is delivered.

1352
02:20:05,083 --> 02:20:06,041
Uncle?

1353
02:20:14,875 --> 02:20:16,041
It's Manoj Roy!

1354
02:20:57,791 --> 02:20:59,125
S-Shyam.

1355
02:21:02,041 --> 02:21:03,208
Shyam.

1356
02:21:10,125 --> 02:21:11,500
Mr. Manoj Singha Roy,

1357
02:21:11,791 --> 02:21:14,583
please tell the court
what you want to say about this case.

1358
02:21:21,458 --> 02:21:24,208
Vasudev is Shyam Singha Roy.

1359
02:21:27,083 --> 02:21:28,583
I believe that my brother, Shyam,

1360
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:35,333
has been reincarnated as Vasu.

1361
02:21:35,916 --> 02:21:37,375
I firmly believe it.

1362
02:21:44,208 --> 02:21:47,833
He is Shyam Singha Roy.

1363
02:21:54,666 --> 02:21:56,166
What are you saying, Uncle?

1364
02:21:58,916 --> 02:22:00,208
Silence in the court, please!

1365
02:22:02,083 --> 02:22:03,208
Please! Thank you.

1366
02:22:03,916 --> 02:22:05,083
Pardon me, Your Honor.

1367
02:22:05,458 --> 02:22:06,375
Mr. Roy...

1368
02:22:07,958 --> 02:22:11,666
You are claiming that your brother,
Shyam, who died 45 years ago,

1369
02:22:11,791 --> 02:22:14,375
has been reincarnated as Vasudev.

1370
02:22:14,458 --> 02:22:16,208
You are 85 years old.

1371
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:17,791
It's your belief. Fine!

1372
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:23,208
But why should I, and the honorable judge,
this court, and the public believe you?

1373
02:22:23,416 --> 02:22:24,875
Can you give me one good reason why?

1374
02:22:27,833 --> 02:22:29,500
Do you have any evidence to prove

1375
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:32,000
that Vasu did not plagiarize
Shyam Singha Roy's stories?

1376
02:22:34,958 --> 02:22:39,625
Do you have any substantial proof
of Shyam Singha Roy's reincarnation?

1377
02:22:39,791 --> 02:22:42,208
I'm asking you, Mr. Roy. Please tell me.
The court wants to know.

1378
02:22:42,833 --> 02:22:43,958
Yes, I have.

1379
02:22:44,541 --> 02:22:45,625
I have proof.

1380
02:22:46,666 --> 02:22:49,500
A secret which
I was likely to take to my grave,

1381
02:22:49,958 --> 02:22:53,041
the venomous side
of the Singha Roy family,

1382
02:22:53,625 --> 02:22:56,583
has been revealed by someone in the court.

1383
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:59,666
I was shell-shocked by that.

1384
02:23:12,125 --> 02:23:16,666
Anyone can plagiarize
from the published books.

1385
02:23:16,750 --> 02:23:19,166
But there's a short story
that has never been published.

1386
02:23:19,250 --> 02:23:22,250
And no one knows about its existence,
except for me.

1387
02:23:28,083 --> 02:23:30,791
How could Mr. Vasudev make it
as a short film?

1388
02:23:30,875 --> 02:23:32,750
Who gave that story to him?

1389
02:23:33,083 --> 02:23:33,916
A small story.

1390
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,375
The story is...

1391
02:24:00,791 --> 02:24:05,291
This is the only copy of that story,
written by Shyam himself.

1392
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:16,750
VARNAM

1393
02:24:31,791 --> 02:24:36,750
As the Chairman of SR Publishers,
I withdraw this case.

1394
02:24:39,666 --> 02:24:42,666
Because he is not just
the owner of these three stories.

1395
02:24:43,375 --> 02:24:45,916
He's the owner of the whole company.

1396
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,250
Since the petitioners have withdrawn
the case,

1397
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:54,916
the case is closed.

1398
02:25:07,166 --> 02:25:08,916
I didn't lose, but you have won.

1399
02:25:10,083 --> 02:25:11,041
Good job.

1400
02:25:11,916 --> 02:25:14,000
I'll see you in court again. All the best.

1401
02:25:26,541 --> 02:25:27,708
Mannu.

1402
02:25:36,666 --> 02:25:38,500
Please forgive me, Shyam.

1403
02:25:39,708 --> 02:25:41,250
I was responsible for your death.

1404
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:47,125
I didn't know that our brothers
would do that to you.

1405
02:25:48,958 --> 02:25:50,291
You were very stubborn.

1406
02:25:51,666 --> 02:25:53,333
That's why you are born again.

1407
02:25:58,333 --> 02:26:00,166
Your stories found their way back to you.

1408
02:26:00,916 --> 02:26:02,666
Your stories saved you.

1409
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:08,708
This company, all the assets...
It all belongs to you.

1410
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:10,750
Take it.

1411
02:26:12,291 --> 02:26:13,833
What should I do with them?

1412
02:26:16,083 --> 02:26:19,750
I promised Rosie
that I would spend a lifetime with her.

1413
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:24,875
But I left her midway.

1414
02:26:28,750 --> 02:26:31,583
Rosie must have waited for me
until her last breath.

1415
02:26:36,125 --> 02:26:38,125
I don't know why I was reborn.

1416
02:26:43,333 --> 02:26:44,291
Rosie...

1417
02:26:45,666 --> 02:26:47,333
Rosie is alive.

1418
02:26:50,791 --> 02:26:53,041
She is waiting for you.

1419
02:26:55,250 --> 02:26:56,333
You mean, Rosie...

1420
02:26:57,208 --> 02:26:59,000
Is very much alive.

1421
02:27:11,083 --> 02:27:13,541
