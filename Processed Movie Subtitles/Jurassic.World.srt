1
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,712
Boys, let's do this!

2
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,720
Gray?

3
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,889
Honey, what
are you doing?

4
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,557
What is this?
Here. Let's go.

5
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,643
Come on, honey.
Your flight's
in two hours.

6
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,063
Dane County Airport
is 36 minutes away,
60 with traffic.

7
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,857
How many minutes
to get your little
butt in the van?

8
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,941
Hmm?

9
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,069
How many of those?

10
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,072
Feed the monster
under your bed'
- Yes.

11
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
Call me every day,

12
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,829
and text me pics,
so I don't forget
what you look like.

13
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,122
I'm only gonna
be gone a week.

14
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:45,248
Zach.

15
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,752
You're not going off
to war here. Please.

16
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,170
Come on.

17
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,090
I will see you later.
I love you.

18
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,257
Vamonos.

19
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,259
Bye, okay?
Bye.

20
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,512
Are
you in, buddy?

21
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,600
I know it hurts,
sweetheart.

22
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,060
Are you gonna be okay?

23
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,109
Everything right
on there?

24
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,444
I'm so jealous.

25
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,239
You're gonna
have so much fun.
I love you.

26
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,907
I love you, too.

27
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,541
Okay, great.

28
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,544
All right, um,
let's give these
to your brother, okay?

29
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,422
You hold these, please.
Can you hold these?
Zach.

30
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,173
Honey, I need you to
take care of these.

31
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,091
Yeah.

32
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,175
- Hey.
- All right.

33
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,468
Listen to your mother.

34
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,096
Take care
of your brother.
Answer your phone.

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,889
I'm serious.
It's the green button.

36
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,975
When you see my name,
push it, okay?

37
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,143
And remember,

38
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,020
something chases you, run.

39
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,189
Come on.

40
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,066
All right.
You're funny.
Okay, let's go. Come on.

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,735
Bye, guys.
Bye.

42
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,570
I miss you already.
Yeah.

43
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,366
So much for our
last family breakfast.

44
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,661
Why do you have to
say things like that?

45
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,081
Did you
call your sister?

46
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,167
Straight to voicemail.

47
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,462
It'll be fine.
She handles 20,000
people a day, right?

48
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,465
She can handle
two more.

49
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,970
How big
is the island?

50
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,764
Big.

51
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,348
But how many pounds?

52
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,808
That
doesn't make sense.

53
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,939
When they first opened,
they had eight species.

54
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,942
Now they have 14 herbivores
and six carnivores.

55
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,819
That's 50 tons
of food a week.

56
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,009
Welcome to Isla Nublar,
home of Jurassic World.

57
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,012
We hope you
have a safe and
enjoyable stay with us.

58
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,892
Where's Aunt Claire?

59
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,333
Okay. Those of you in
the front of the train

60
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,585
should be able to
see our main gates.

61
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,850
Please obey all park rules.

62
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,728
Proper attire,
including shoes and shirts,
must be worn at all times.

63
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:57,607
Your aunt arranged
to greet you at 1:00.
Can he slow down?

64
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,733
Nope.

65
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,443
Come on!

66
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,493
Your aunt's got
you VIP access,

67
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,954
so you can get
in all the rides
without waiting in line.

68
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,163
Let's go.

69
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,248
Dude, she said
we had to wait.

70
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,250
I don't wanna
wait anymore.

71
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,699
Hal Osterly, vice president.
Jim Drucker, bad hair.

72
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,201
Erica Brand,
deserves better.

73
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,996
Hal, Jim, Erica.
Hal, Jim, Erica.

74
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,540
And I am Claire.

75
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,250
Three minutes late.

76
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,173
Welcome to Jurassic World.

77
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,010
While year over year,
revenue continues to climb,

78
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,304
operating costs
are higher than ever.

79
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:13,099
Our shareholders
have been patient,
but let's be honest,

80
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,269
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

81
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,481
Twenty years ago,
de-extinction was right
up there with magic.

82
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,274
These days, kids
look at a Stegosaurus

83
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,735
like an elephant
from the city zoo.

84
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,154
That doesn't mean
asset development
is falling behind.

85
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,617
Our DNA excavators
discover new
species every year.

86
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,246
But consumers
want them bigger,
louder, more teeth.

87
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,374
The good news?

88
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,502
Our advances in gene
splicing have opened up
a whole new frontier.

89
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,547
We've learned
more from genetics
in the past decade

90
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,633
than a century of
digging up bones.

91
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,593
So,

92
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,555
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction,

93
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,890
what do you have in mind?

94
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,143
We want to be thrilled.

95
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,728
Don't we all?

96
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
The Indominus rex.

97
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,153
Our first genetically
modified hybrid.

98
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,657
How did you get
two different kinds of
dinosaurs to, you know...

99
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,161
Oh, Indominus wasn't bred.
She was designed.

100
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,499
She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown.

101
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,251
Bigger than the T. rex.

102
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:25,088
Every time we've
unveiled a new asset,
attendance has spiked.

103
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,967
Global news coverage,
celebrity visitors.

104
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,427
Eyes of the world.

105
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,178
When will she be ready?

106
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,182
She already is.

107
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
Come on!

108
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,574
Relax.

109
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,159
Come on.

110
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,202
Dude, chill.

111
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,833
Welcome
to the Innovation Center,

112
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,419
where technology
meets prehistory.

113
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,097
The Triceratops
can go horn-to-tooth
with the apex predators.

114
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,434
Literally meaning
"three-horned face"
in Greek,

115
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,645
Triceratops Is
half as tall as T. rex

116
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,649
_...as one-hundred
trillion tons of TNT.

117
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,903
...turn its head back
to look over its shoulder

118
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,323
to better aim the swing
of its dangerous tail.

119
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,662
Cytosine, guanine,
adenine, and thymine.

120
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,372
The same four things in
everything that ever lived.

121
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,041
Hey, don't wander off,
all right?

122
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,210
Mom's not paying
me for babysitting.

123
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,797
Gray, is that you?

124
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,881
Aunt Claire!

125
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,008
Okay, yeah.
No, I'm gonna have to go.
My nephews are here.

126
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,636
Hi.

127
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,929
Oh.

128
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,473
Oh, my gosh,
you're so sweet.

129
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,726
Whoa, Zach.

130
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,062
Last time I saw you,
you were like...

131
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,355
That must've
been what?

132
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,607
Three, four years ago?
- Uh, Seven.

133
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,567
Seven years,
but, you Know, close.

134
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,321
So, I see you already
got your wristbands.

135
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,865
And this is for food.

136
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,409
And Zara here
is going to take
great care of you

137
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,203
until I'm done
working tonight, okay?

138
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,663
You're not coming with us?

139
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,581
Oh...

140
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,875
I really wish
that I could,

141
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,962
but tomorrow I can take you
into the control room,

142
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,089
show you behind the
scenes and all of that.

143
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,842
That's gonna be cool, right?

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,890
Okay, so I will see
you tonight at 6:00.

145
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,183
No, don't forget
you have the...

146
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,394
Right, of course.
I will see you
tonight at 8:00.

147
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:49,190
What time do you go to sleep?
Or do you go to
sleep at different times?

148
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,736
Okay, so, have fun,

149
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,406
and take very good
care of them, okay?

150
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,534
Yeah. No, I'm here.

151
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,457
It's those
two juvenile Triceratops.
They're going at it again.

152
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,709
Should I trang them,
or are you

153
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,294
coming over to
take care of this?

154
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,045
Go ahead and trang them.

155
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,213
They're running.

156
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,923
What's the live count?

157
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,758
22,216.

158
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,010
Any incidents?
- Yes.

159
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,055
Six kids in
the Lost and Found,
28 down with heatstroke...

160
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,349
Where did you get that?

161
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,895
Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

162
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,273
I got it for $150,
but the mint condition
one goes for $300...

163
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
Didn't occur to you maybe
that's in poor taste?

164
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,235
The shirt?
Yeah, no, it did.

165
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,990
I understand people died.
It was terrible,
but that first park was legit.

166
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,992
I have a lot of
respect for it.

167
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,744
They didn't need
these genetic hybrids.

168
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,704
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

169
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,915
Okay, please don't
wear it again.
That's kind of enough.

170
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,124
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

171
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,959
Did you close the deal?
- Looks like it.

172
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,963
Verizon Wireless
presents the Indominus rex.

173
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,465
Ugh, that is so terrible.

174
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,717
Why not just go
the distance, Claire,

175
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,511
and just let
these corporations
name the dinosaurs?

176
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,846
They've got
all the ballparks.

177
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,307
Why stop there?
Why are the
West Plains closed?

178
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,768
Another Pachy roaming
outside his zone.

179
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,937
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

180
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,813
Pepsi-saurus
or Tostito-don.

181
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,941
Security said
the invisible fences
were a no-fail.

182
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,651
That is the second
time this month.

183
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,029
Well, the Pachys
short out their implants
when they butt heads.

184
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,198
How much longer
until they get
it out of there?

185
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,575
He just got five
milligrams of carfentanil.

186
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:27,038
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we
show a little sympathy?

187
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,416
I mean, you do
understand these are
actual animals, right?

188
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,255
Clean up your workspace.
It's chaotic.

189
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,466
I like to think of
it as a living system.

190
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:43,012
Just enough stability
to keep it from
collapsing into anarchy.

191
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,356
Inbound chopper,
Jurassic 1. ETA, 5 minutes.

192
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,880
Claire.

193
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,801
Mr. Masrani.
You are flying.

194
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,386
I got my license.

195
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,722
Two more.
Well, two more days.

196
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,931
Okay.
So,

197
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,058
how's my park doing?
- Great.

198
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,102
We're up 2.5% over last year.

199
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,271
A bit lower than our
initial projection.

200
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,814
No, no, no, how's it doing?

201
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,026
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

202
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,696
Well, guest
satisfaction is steady
in the low 90s.

203
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,326
We don't have a way
to measure the animals'
emotional experience.

204
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,995
Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes.

205
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,330
Right?

206
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,789
Of course.

207
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,918
Okay. Now show me
my new dinosaur.

208
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,255
Oh...

209
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,053
Got it.

210
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,387
Got it.

211
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,389
Got it.

212
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, my!

213
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,030
You look tense, Claire.

214
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,618
Maybe you should just
focus on the controls.

215
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,953
The key to a happy
life is to accept

216
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,706
you are never
actually in control.

217
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,874
Bird!

218
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,423
You should spend
a day at the beach.
Get some sun.

219
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,050
Uh, right, so...

220
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,804
Marketing thought
we could offset
some of the costs by...

221
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,972
Enough about cost.

222
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,141
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,

223
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,394
and not once did
he mention profits.

224
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,604
"Spare no expense,"
he used to say.

225
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,688
I appreciate that,

226
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,192
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires...

227
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

228
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,739
Jurassic World
exists to remind us
how very small we are.

229
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,826
How new. You can't
put a price on that.

230
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,329
Now, please, we're flying.

231
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,207
Breathe.

232
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,486
Is he okay?
Are you okay?

233
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,905
He's just being dramatic.

234
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,782
Are you still building?

235
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,368
We planned
to open in May,

236
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:56,205
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

237
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,374
It's bigger
than expected.

238
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,923
It's a good sign.

239
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,678
We hit a few
speed bumps early on.

240
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,890
It began to anticipate
where the food
would come from.

241
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,892
One of the handlers
nearly lost an arm.

242
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,896
The others threatened
to quit if I couldn't
guarantee their safety.

243
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,190
She's intelligent then?

244
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,400
For a dinosaur.

245
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,569
And that?

246
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,783
It tried to
break the glass.

247
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,912
I like her spirit.

248
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,853
It's white. You never
told me it was white.

249
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,444
Think it will scare the kids?

250
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,197
The kids?

251
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,367
This will give the
parents nightmares.

252
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,495
Is that good?

253
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,582
It's fantastic.

254
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,380
Can she see us?

255
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,216
They say it can
sense thermal radiation.

256
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,592
Like snakes.

257
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,679
I thought there
were two of them.

258
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,224
There was a sibling
in case this one
didn't survive infancy.

259
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,309
Where's the sibling?

260
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,477
She ate it.

261
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,322
So, the paddock is
quite safe, then?

262
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,994
We have the best
structural engineers
in the world.

263
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah, so did Hammond.

264
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,333
There's an American
Navy man here.

265
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,378
Part of a research
program one of my
companies is running.

266
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,130
Owen Grady.

267
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,382
I Know who he is.

268
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,426
His animals
often try to escape.

269
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,429
They are smart.
He has to be smarter.

270
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,222
He only thinks
he's smarter.

271
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,684
I want you to bring him in.

272
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,769
Let him inspect the paddock.

273
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,316
Maybe he sees
something we can't.

274
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,208
Hold!

275
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,133
Hey!

276
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,889
Okay!

277
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:01,891
Eyes on me.

278
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,517
Blue?

279
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,269
Blue!

280
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,146
Watch it.

281
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,522
Charlie. Hey!

282
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,359
Don't give me that shit!

283
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,568
Delta!

284
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,070
Lock it up!

285
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,697
Good!

286
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,908
And we're moving!

287
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,957
Hold!

288
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,088
That's good.
That is damn good.

289
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,964
Very good!

290
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,425
See, Charlie,
that's what you get!

291
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,220
Echo, there you go!
Delta!

292
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,098
Blue?

293
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,603
This one's for you.

294
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,607
Hold!

295
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,567
Eyes up!

296
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,863
Go.

297
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,539
You finally did it, man.

298
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,623
Owen.

299
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,712
I was starting to think
I hired the wrong guys,

300
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,797
but, damn, you got them
eating out of your palm.

301
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,049
You came on a good day.
It's not usually
a happy ending.

302
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,884
Is that why you're not
sending in your reports?

303
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,344
We've been busy.

304
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,055
Not too busy to
cash your paychecks.

305
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,141
What do you need, buddy?

306
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,934
A field test.

307
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,397
Hey. I've just
seen they can
respond to commands.

308
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,899
We need to take the research
and get it on its feet.

309
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,359
These are wild
animals, Hoskins.

310
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,278
Trust me, you don't
want them in the field.

311
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,573
I just saw a bond.
A real bond.

312
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,742
Between man and beast.

313
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,826
You're in my way.

314
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,286
Come on.
We're the same.

315
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,829
We're dogs of war.

316
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,999
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

317
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,084
Some people think that
robots are the future.

318
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,712
Look, nature gave
us the most effective

319
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,339
killing machines 75
million years ago.

320
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,925
And now we know
they can take orders.

321
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,678
We finally make
progress and that's
the first thing he says?

322
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,346
Make a weapon?

323
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,806
Shit.

324
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,224
Come on, gents.

325
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,351
It's grown-up time.

326
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:13,147
Drones can't search
tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

327
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,607
The minute a real
war breaks out,

328
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,942
all that fancy
tech is gonna go dark.

329
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,029
But that tech's
not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

330
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,531
Look at these creatures.

331
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,451
They've got millions
of years of instinct
in their cells,

332
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,619
instinct that
we can program.

333
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,164
Their loyalty
cannot be bought.

334
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,374
These guys
are gonna run

335
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,418
straight into the enemy's
teeth and eat them,

336
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,462
belt buckle and all.

337
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,964
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

338
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,218
Well, then we
remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

339
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,553
Promote only
loyal bloodlines.

340
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,098
What? ;
What's so funny'

341
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,436
I don't Know.
You come here

342
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,063
and you don't learn
anything about these animals

343
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,856
except what you
want to know.

344
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,693
You made them,
and now you
think you own them.

345
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,487
We do own them.

346
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,406
Extinct animals
have no rights.

347
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,325
They're not extinct
anymore, Hoskins.

348
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,662
Exactly. We're
sitting on a goldmine.

349
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,123
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

350
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,043
He just wants to
teach people some humility.
He doesn't make weapons.

351
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,838
You think
that the eighth richest
man in the world

352
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,425
is only into oil, telecom,
and family fun parks?

353
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,344
He's so diversified,
he doesn't even
know what he owns.

354
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,638
How long has InGen
been practicing this pitch?

355
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:31,767
Since the day we
hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.

356
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,688
These animals can
replace thousands of
boots on the ground.

357
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,773
How many lives
would that save?

358
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,569
War is part of nature.

359
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,240
Look around, Owen.
Every living
thing in this jungle

360
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,826
is trying to murder the other.

361
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:52,037
Mother Nature's way of
testing her creations.

362
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,540
Refining the
pecking order.

363
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,751
War is a Struggle.
Struggle breeds greatness.

364
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,045
Without that,

365
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,048
we end up with
places like this,
charge seven bucks a soda.

366
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,218
Do you hear yourself
when you talk?

367
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,893
This is gonna happen.
With or without you boys.

368
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,436
Progress always wins, man.

369
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,397
Maybe progress
should lose for once.

370
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,859
Pig loose!

371
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,153
Pig loose!

372
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,713
Owen, no!

373
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,302
No, hold your fire!

374
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,181
Hold your fire.
Do not fire.

375
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,269
Put 12 amps in these
animals, they're never
gonna trust me again.

376
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,107
Blue, stand down.

377
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,069
Stand down.

378
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,697
Hey! What did I just say?

379
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:12,159
Delta, I see you.
Back up!

380
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,704
Okay.

381
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,914
Good.

382
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,124
Good.

383
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,709
Charlie?

384
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:23,504
Stay right there.

385
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,465
Good.

386
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,301
Close the gate.

387
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,512
Are you crazy?

388
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,554
Just trust me.

389
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,722
Close the gate!

390
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,570
I'm okay.

391
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,784
Yeah.

392
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,707
You're the new
guy, right?

393
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,417
Yeah.

394
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,919
You ever wonder why
there was a job opening?

395
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,089
Hey.

396
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,758
Don't ever turn
your back to the cage.

397
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,846
Lift me up.
I can't see!

398
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,140
I'm not Dad. I
And you're not five.

399
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,519
I can still ride
the Triceratops.
I'm 47-and-a-half inches.

400
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,854
This place is
for little kids.

401
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,732
Yeah, I know.

402
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,068
Wanna go on the ;
spinning dinosaur eggs'
Nope.

403
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,279
Cover up your
dork pouch.

404
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,989
Because
it's my wedding.

405
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,366
No, Alec's not
having a bachelor party.

406
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,118
Because all his
friends are animals.

407
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,369
Scatter.

408
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,663
What?
Go. Run. Go!

409
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,961
Yuck!

410
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,145
The next T. rex feeding
will begin in 10 minutes.

411
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,147
T. rex! Come on, man!
Come on!
Okay.

412
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,565
Let's go!

413
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,526
Parents be aware,
this show may be

414
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,653
disturbing for
smaller children.

415
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,791
Hey, Mom.

416
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,961
You were
supposed to call me
when you landed.

417
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:10,170
Are you having fun?

418
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,131
Yeah, I guess.

419
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,593
Aunt Claire gave us passes,
so we don't have
to wait in line.

420
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,178
Wait, she's
not with you?

421
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,394
Hey, Karen!

422
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,521
Hi, Claire. How's it going?

423
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:30,149
Yeah, everything's great.
The boys are having fun.

424
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,860
Everyone's...
Yeah, everyone's good.

425
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,444
Really? Because I
just hung up with Zach,

426
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,321
and he said that you
weren't even with them.

427
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,910
Yeah, look.
Today turned out to be
a really bad day for me.

428
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,539
They're in great hands.
They're with my assistant.

429
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,668
She's British,
so they invented nannies.

430
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,589
Wait, are you crying?

431
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,885
This was supposed to be
a family weekend, Claire.

432
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,469
You haven't seen
the boys in forever.

433
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,763
And I know how
Zach will treat Gray
if they're by themselves.

434
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,932
And he can just be so mean.

435
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,934
Okay, I'm sorry.

436
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,646
Tomorrow, I'm gonna spend
the entire day with them.

437
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,232
I'm going to take off work,
and I will not
leave their side.

438
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,483
I promise.

439
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,029
Well, a promise tomorrow
is worth a lot less
than trying today.

440
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,948
Ew! You're using
Mom's lines now?

441
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,492
Oh, my God.
lam using Mom's lines.

442
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,453
I'm sorry, but you know,
I have to tell you, they work.

443
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,288
You'll see when
you have kids.

444
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,456
Yeah, "if."

445
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:31,001
"When." It's worth it.

446
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,794
Bye, Mom.

447
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,715
Bye.

448
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,776
What do they want now?

449
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:56,944
Mr. Grady?

450
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,782
I need you to come
take a look at something.

451
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,285
Why are you calling
me Mr. Grady?

452
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,787
Owen.

453
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,748
If you're not too busy.

454
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,958
I'm pretty busy.

455
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,584
We have an attraction.

456
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,586
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

457
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,922
I'm talking about
the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.

458
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,507
Owen.

459
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,717
A new species we've made.

460
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,848
You just went and
made a new dinosaur?

461
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,018
Yeah, it's kind
of what we do here.

462
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,895
The exhibit
opens to the public
in three weeks.

463
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,108
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

464
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,445
You wanna consult
here or in my bungalow?

465
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,948
That's not funny.

466
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,033
A little funny.

467
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,995
We'd like you to
evaluate the paddock
for vulnerabilities.

468
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,705
Why me?

469
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:56,503
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to
control the Raptors...

470
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,963
It's all about
control with you.

471
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,258
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

472
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,552
It's based on mutual respect.

473
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,763
That's why you and I
never had a second date.

474
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,683
Excuse me?
I never wanted
a second date.

475
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,727
Who prints out an
itinerary for a night out?

476
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,395
I'm an organized person.

477
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,023
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

478
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,816
All of them,
actually.

479
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:22,279
And what kind of
a man shows up to
a date in board shorts?

480
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,448
It's Central America.
It's hot.
Okay. Okay.

481
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,451
Can we just focus
on the asset, please?

482
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,952
The asset?

483
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,831
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

484
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,166
You gotta make a lot
of tough decisions.

485
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,584
It's probably easier
to pretend these animals

486
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,086
are just numbers
on a spreadsheet.

487
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,839
But they're not.
They're alive.

488
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,592
I'm fully aware
they're alive.

489
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,386
You might have made
them in a test tube,
but they don't Know that.

490
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,722
They're thinking,
"I gotta eat.

491
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,267
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

492
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,856
You can relate to at
least one of those things.

493
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,107
Right?

494
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:03,904
I'll be in the car.

495
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,202
You might want to
change your shirt.

496
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,497
They're very
sensitive to smell.

497
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,257
The Mosasaurus

498
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,968
was thought to have
hunted near the
surface of the water

499
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,305
where it preyed on anything
it could sink its teeth into,

500
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,977
including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs.

501
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:40,857
Okay, folks, let's see
if she's still hungry
after already eating today.

502
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,570
She's a little shy,
so be nice and give her
a hand when she comes out.

503
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,280
Zach, Zach!

504
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,156
The Mosasaurus!

505
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,046
Oh, my God!
That was awesome!

506
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,426
Hold on tight.

507
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,805
We're gonna give you
an even closer
look at our Mosasaurus.

508
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,696
I
It had 88 teeth!

509
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,783
Wanna see ;
something else cool'
Yeah!

510
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,210
We've
been pre-booking
tickets for months.

511
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,130
The park needs
a new attraction
every few years

512
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,466
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

513
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,468
Kind of like
the space program.

514
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,138
Corporate felt
genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

515
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,265
They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough.

516
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,767
Not according to
our focus groups.

517
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,061
The Indominus rex
makes us relevant again.

518
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,189
The Indominus rex?

519
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,317
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

520
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,776
You should hear
a four-year-old

521
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,945
try to say
"Archaeornithomimus. "

522
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,323
You should hear
you try to say it.

523
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,497
So what's this
thing made of?

524
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,960
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

525
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,755
You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't
even know what it is?

526
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,798
The lab delivers
us finished assets,

527
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,258
and we show
them to the public.

528
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,302
Can we drop a steer, please?

529
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,304
How long has the
animal been in here?

530
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,389
All its life.

531
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,767
Never seen anything
outside of these walls?

532
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,143
We can't exactly walk it.

533
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,811
And you feed it
with that?

534
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,818
Is there a problem?

535
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,280
Animals raised in
isolation aren't always
the most functional.

536
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,867
Your Raptors are
born in captivity.

537
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:59,454
With siblings.
They learn social skills.

538
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,164
And I imprint on
them when they're born.

539
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:02,582
There's trust.

540
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:06,795
The only positive
relationship this animal
has is with that crane.

541
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,297
At least she
knows that means food.

542
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,300
So, she needs a friend.

543
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,804
We should schedule
play-dates?
That sort of thing?

544
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,722
Probably not
a good idea.

545
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,228
Where is it?

546
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,479
Is it in the basement?

547
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,983
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

548
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,318
It was just here.
We were just here.

549
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,996
Oh, shit.

550
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,875
That doesn't
make any sense.

551
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,796
These doors haven't
been opened in weeks.

552
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,425
Were those claw
marks always there?

553
00:34:58,847 --> 00:34:59,848
Do you think it...

554
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,562
Oh, God.

555
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,355
She has an
implant in her back.

556
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,108
I can track it
from the control room.

557
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,578
We have an asset
out of containment.

558
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,331
Put ACU on alert.
This is not a drill.

559
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,125
Even though I didn't
meet him until I was 13,

560
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,877
I definitely
consider Carl to be

561
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,462
more of a dad
than my real dad.

562
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,302
Yeah, hello?
- Lowery.

563
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,179
Get me coordinates
on the Indominus.

564
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,598
Okay, yeah.

565
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,225
I'm doing it right now.

566
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,377
That wall
is 40 feet high.

567
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,338
Do you really think
she could have climbed out?

568
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,340
It depends.

569
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,716
On what?

570
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,220
What kind of dinosaur
they cooked up in that lab.

571
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,099
Wait,
what the hell?

572
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,934
It's in the cage.

573
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,269
No, that's impossible.
I was just there.

574
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,230
Claire, I'm telling you,
she's in the cage.

575
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,400
Wait a sec.

576
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,859
There are people in there.

577
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:38,780
Get them out of there now.

578
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,864
Now!

579
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,076
Paddock 11, this is Control.
You need to evacuate
the containment area.

580
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,495
Paddock 717.

581
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,164
Paddock 11, do you copy?

582
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:49,666
Yeah, what's the problem?

583
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,459
It's in the cage!
It's in there with you!

584
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,460
Go!

585
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,158
Close the door.

586
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,410
We cant lock him in
there with that thing.
Close it now!

587
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,578
Somebody talk to me!

588
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,746
What is happening?

589
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,166
Shit!

590
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,465
Everyone remain calm.

591
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,394
The implant will shock it
if it gets too close
to a perimeter fence.

592
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,062
Okay. It's moving
really fast.

593
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,981
This is Control.
Put out a park-wide alert.

594
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,108
Hang up that
damn phone, please.

595
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,444
Sorry, I'm getting
new information.
Everything's fine.

596
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,988
Let Asset Containment
capture it quietly.

597
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,450
The very existence
of this park is
predicated on our ability

598
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,327
to handle
incidents like this.

599
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,245
It was an
eventuality, okay?

600
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,080
You should put
that in the brochure.

601
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,584
"Eventually,
one of these things
will eat Somebody."

602
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,046
That paddock is four miles
from the closest attraction.

603
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,632
ACU can handle this.
No one else is gonna get...

604
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,216
Eaten?

605
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,309
To all units.
This is a non-lethal
operation. Understood?

606
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,859
How
fast can they run?

607
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,694
Forty.

608
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,571
Fifty when
they're hungry.

609
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:49,656
Ooh!

610
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,076
You ever open them up,
see what they can do?

611
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,161
No.

612
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,871
Oh, shit!

613
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,457
That got me.
It got me.

614
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,085
What do you think?
Want to take one home?

615
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,461
Hey, don't joke.

616
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,463
When I was your age,

617
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,882
I rescued a wolf pup.

618
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,886
It was, like, two months old.
It could barely walk.

619
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,722
It used to sleep by my bed.

620
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,099
Watch over me.

621
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,979
My wife, she came at
me with a steak knife.

622
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,522
It took a chunk
out of her arm.

623
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,107
Did you put him down?

624
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,943
Hell, no.

625
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,780
We had an unshakeable
bond, you know?

626
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,824
Just like you and...

627
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,618
What's his name?

628
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,955
Delta. And she's a girl.

629
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,040
Can l...

630
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:54,303
Oh, wow.

631
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,937
Code 19!

632
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,355
That's the new one!

633
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:05,565
They said we lost two guys!

634
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:06,899
What's a Code 19?

635
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,861
That's Indominus!
Asset out of containment.

636
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,071
These people,
they never learn.

637
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,952
They're gonna learn
all kinds of things
about their new asset now.

638
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:25,251
Hey. Yeah, it's me.
We might have
an opportunity here.

639
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,396
You guys been
here before?

640
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,067
If Mom and Dad
get divorced,

641
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,152
will one of us
be with Mom
and the other with Dad?

642
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,696
What? Why would
you say that?

643
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,864
Because they are.

644
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,909
No, they're not getting...
They're not getting divorced.

645
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,621
Look. You haven't
been around long enough.
They've always been that way.

646
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,165
They get mail from
two different lawyers.

647
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,000
That doesn't
mean anything.

648
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,919
I googled.
They're divorce lawyers.

649
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:12,882
All right, whatever.

650
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,426
You know what?
It doesn't matter, okay?

651
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,844
I'm gonna be gone
in two years anyway.

652
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,889
I mean, all my friends'
parents are divorced.

653
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,768
Hey, knock it off.

654
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,062
You're gonna cry?

655
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,899
Look. You're gonna get
two of everything, right?

656
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,860
You're gonna
get two birthdays,
two Thanksgivings, two...

657
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,862
I don't want
two of everything.

658
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,448
Yeah, well,
it's not up to you.

659
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,368
All right? There's a point
you have to grow up.

660
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,234
I need to see a badge.
Sir, I need to see a badge.

661
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,902
What the hell ;
happened out there'
Sir.

662
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,488
There are thermal cameras
all over that paddock.

663
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,574
She did not just disappear!

664
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,578
It must have been
some kind of a
technical malfunction.

665
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,163
Were you not watching?

666
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:26,998
She marked up that
wall as a distraction.

667
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,624
She wanted us to
think she escaped!

668
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,585
Hold on. We are talking
about an animal here.

669
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,837
A highly
intelligent animal.

670
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,547
400 meters to the beacon.

671
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,114
You're going after
her with non-lethals.

672
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:03,868
We have $26 million
invested in that asset.
We can't just kill it.

673
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,703
Those men are gonna die.

674
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,954
300 meters
to the beacon.

675
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,289
You need
to call this mission
off right now.

676
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,248
They're
right on top of it.

677
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:10,458
Call it off right now.

678
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,543
You are not in control here!

679
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,118
Blood's not clotted yet.

680
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,828
It's close.

681
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,206
What is that?

682
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,335
That's her tracking implant.
She clawed it out.

683
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,337
How would
it Know to do that?

684
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,840
She remembered
where they put it in.

685
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,625
It can camouflage!

686
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,892
Evacuate the island.

687
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,020
We'd never reopen.

688
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,608
You made a genetic hybrid,
raised it in captivity.

689
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,402
She is seeing all of
this for the first time.

690
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:46,030
She does not even
know what she is.

691
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,824
She will kill
everything that moves.

692
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:51,786
Do you think the animal
is contemplating
its own existence?

693
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,496
She is learning
where she fits
in the food chain,

694
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,706
and I'm not sure
you want her
to figure that out.

695
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,209
Now, Asset Containment
can use live ammunition

696
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,960
in an emergency situation.

697
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,921
You have an M134
in your armory.

698
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,923
Put it on a chopper
and smoke this thing!

699
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,216
We have families here.

700
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,551
I'm not gonna turn
this place into some
kind of a war zone.

701
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,886
You already have.

702
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,139
Mr. Grady, if you're not
gonna help, there's no reason
for you to be in here.

703
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:22,400
I would have
a word with your
people in the lab.

704
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:26,195
That thing out there,
that's no dinosaur.

705
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,504
Okay.

706
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,509
I'm going to close everything
north of the resort.

707
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:52,054
This is a Phase One,
real world.
Bring everyone in.

708
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,014
This is a Phase One,
real world.

709
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,516
I repeat, this
is a Phase One.

710
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,101
Bring everyone back in.

711
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,105
Did you know

712
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,732
the soft tissue is preserved
because the iron in
the dinosaur's blood

713
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:06,694
generates free radicals,
and those are highly reactive.

714
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,530
So, the proteins
and the cell membranes
get all mixed up,

715
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,241
and act as a
natural preservative.

716
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,535
DNA can survive for
millennia that way.

717
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,371
See, now, even if
the amber mines dry up,
they'll still have bones...

718
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,081
Shut up.

719
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,295
What do you
think's gonna happen
from you just staring at them?

720
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,340
Thanks, man.

721
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,550
You're welcome.

722
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,053
Enjoy the ride.

723
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,518
Pregnant women
and those who suffer
from motion sickness

724
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:41,896
should consult with a doctor
before riding this ride.

725
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,035
Enjoy the ride.

726
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,039
Hello?

727
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,710
Seriously?

728
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,756
Sorry, folks.
The ride is closed.

729
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:13,219
Everyone needs to
proceed to the monorail
and exit towards the...

730
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,849
Come on, guys,
I just work here.

731
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:23,395
Due to
technical difficulties, all
our exhibits are now closed.

732
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,154
You know
that I'm not at liberty

733
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:35,157
to reveal the asset's
genetic makeup.

734
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,785
Modified animals are
known to be unpredictable.

735
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,287
It's killed
people, Henry.

736
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,915
That's unfortunate.

737
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,627
What purpose could we
have for a dinosaur
that can camouflage?

738
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,837
Cuttlefish genes
were added

739
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:52,258
to help her withstand
an accelerated growth rate.

740
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:57,429
Cuttlefish have
chromatophores that allow
the skin to change color.

741
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,139
It hid from
thermal technology.

742
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,559
Really?

743
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,310
How is that possible?

744
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,693
Tree frogs can modulate
their infrared output.

745
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,238
We used strands from
their DNA to adapt her
to a tropical climate.

746
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,282
But I never imagined...

747
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:17,533
Who authorized
you to do this?

748
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,868
You did.

749
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,288
"Bigger."

750
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,290
"Scarier." Um...

751
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:28,586
"Cooler" I believe
is the word that
you used in your memo.

752
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,715
You cannot have an animal
with exaggerated
predator features

753
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,134
without the corresponding
behavioral traits.

754
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,386
What you're
doing here...

755
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,180
What you
have done...

756
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,600
The Board will
shut down this park,

757
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,227
seize your work,
everything you've built.

758
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,689
And Hammond won't be there
to protect you this time.

759
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:52,067
All of this exists
because of me.

760
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,405
If I don't innovate,
somebody else will.

761
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:00,826
You are to cease
all activities
here immediately.

762
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:05,080
You are acting
like we are engaged
in some kind of mad science.

763
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,877
But we are doing
what we have done
from the beginning.

764
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,546
Nothing in Jurassic
World is natural.

765
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,634
We have always
filled gaps in the genome
with the DNA of other animals.

766
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,261
And, if their
genetic code was pure,

767
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,971
many of them would
look quite different.

768
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,891
But you didn't
ask for reality.
You asked for more teeth.

769
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,017
I never asked
for a monster!

770
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,560
"Monster" is
a relative term.

771
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,771
To a canary,
a cat is a monster.

772
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,566
We're just used
to being the cat.

773
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,614
Hey, there.
I'm Jimmy Fallon.

774
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,324
Welcome aboard
the Gyrosphere,

775
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,951
an amazing machine
made possible by science.

776
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,578
Your safety is
our main concern.

777
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,664
Which is why you're behind
our invisible barrier system,

778
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,583
which protects you from things
like Dilophosaurus venom.

779
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,296
One drop of this
can paralyze you,
so watch out.

780
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,965
Is this real? It is?

781
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,093
And for added protection,

782
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,179
each vehicle is surrounded by
aluminum oxynitride glass.

783
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,224
So tough, it can stop
a .50-caliber bullet.

784
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,814
The Gyroscopic technology
will keep you
upright at all times...

785
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,274
Where are they?
...S0 you've got
nothing to worry about.

786
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,693
Oh, man.

787
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,315
Due to technical
difficulties all our
exhibits are now closed.

788
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,235
Please disembark all rides
and return to the resort.

789
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:04,241
Come on, we can stay out
a couple more minutes.

790
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,660
But they said
it was closed.

791
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,871
Aunt Claire gave us
special wristbands, right?

792
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,123
We're VIP, dude.

793
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,126
Come on. It'll be fun.

794
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,658
Hello?
Zara.

795
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,077
I need you to
bring the boys back
to the hotel right away.

796
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,121
I don't know...
I've been looking
everywhere for them.

797
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,165
It's just been
quite a while.
Slow down. I can't hear you.

798
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,708
Zach and Gray,
they've run Off.

799
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,043
They what?

800
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,549
Hey, Claire.

801
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,594
Zach, thank God.
Is Gray with you?

802
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,972
I can't really hear you.
We're in the hamster ball.

803
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,891
Okay. Zach, listen to me.

804
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:12,851
I need you fo...

805
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,187
Hello?

806
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,606
Zach?

807
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,817
Hmm.

808
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,111
Are there any Gyrospheres
left in the Valley?

809
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,696
No, they're all
accounted for.
It's my job.

810
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,450
What? There's
one in the field.

811
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,202
Send a team of rangers,
bring them in.

812
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,204
Security, we need a search
and rescue in the Valley.

813
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,249
It's gonna
be a while. We've got our
hands full out here.

814
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,334
No, there are
two guests missing!

815
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,378
You need to make
this your top priority!

816
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,629
Just do it, man.

817
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,631
There's a lot of
guests missing.
We're doing the best we can.

818
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,341
Okay. Fine.
I'll do it myself.

819
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,302
Do you
think I'm the one you need
to be worried about right now?

820
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,762
Back off!

821
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,604
What happened here?

822
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,318
Dude.

823
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,862
Off-road.

824
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,780
But they told
us to go back.

825
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,782
I'm just worried
you're not getting

826
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,493
the full Jurassic
World experience.

827
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,302
Claire!

828
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,014
I need you.
I need your help.
Okay.

829
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,016
My nephews, they're
out in the Valley.

830
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,350
Please, if anything
happens to them...

831
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,104
How old?

832
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:44,401
The older one,
he's high school age.
The younger one, he's...

833
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,903
He's a few years...

834
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,237
You don't know how
old your nephews are?

835
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,408
No, no.
Bad idea, bad idea.

836
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,492
Great idea.

837
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,369
No! We're
gonna get arrested.

838
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,537
They'll shave our heads,

839
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,414
and we're gonna
have to make root
beer in the toilet.

840
00:56:57,539 --> 00:56:58,874
What are you
talking about?

841
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,418
There.

842
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,713
You see? I told you.

843
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:11,470
You're welcome.
Up close and personal
with four dinosauruses.

844
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,180
Ankylosaurus.

845
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:16,725
We shouldn't be here.
And there's five dinosaurs.

846
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,436
Aren't you
supposed to be
a genius or something?

847
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,604
Look.

848
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,689
One, two, three,

849
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,024
four.

850
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,484
Five.

851
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,830
Go, go, go!
Shit!

852
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,007
Hold it together, man!

853
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,017
Drive! Drive! Go!

854
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,134
We're safe in here, right?

855
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,927
Yeah. They're totally safe.

856
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,892
Come on.

857
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,645
Pick up, pick up,
pick up.

858
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,777
Zach.

859
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,404
I almost got it.

860
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,572
Zach?
Yeah?

861
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,158
Look.
What?

862
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,339
Go! Go!

863
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,179
Gray, go!

864
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,852
Oh, crap!

865
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,779
We're gonna have to jump.
I can't.

866
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,490
Are you ready?
One, two... Come on!

867
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,251
You jumped.

868
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,939
Stay in the car.

869
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,721
Hi.

870
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,806
Hi.

871
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,239
I know, I know.

872
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,708
It's all right.

873
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,835
All right, girl.

874
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,103
Okay.

875
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:54,729
Okay, okay.

876
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,399
You're okay.

877
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,954
It didn't eat them.

878
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,915
It's killing for sport.

879
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,258
Units on standby,
ready for go.

880
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,260
Good. Hold off
on that live feed.

881
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,179
We've got an
evolving situation here.

882
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,222
Did they give you
the green light yet?

883
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:12,640
They will.

884
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,691
Owen, we have
a situation here.

885
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,158
Hey, there.
I'm Jimmy Fallon.

886
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,993
Welcome aboard the Gyrosphere,

887
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,496
an amazing machine
made possible by science.

888
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,374
Hey, there. Your safety
is our main concern.

889
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,584
Now just relax
and enjoy the ride.

890
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,816
No, no, no.

891
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,779
Hey.

892
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,739
They made it out.

893
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,045
Oh, my God,
they jumped.

894
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:25,463
Brave kids.

895
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,133
Zach! Gray!

896
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,177
Hey, I am not one
of your damn animals.

897
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,930
Listen, those
kids are still alive,

898
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:38,393
but you and I will
not be if you continue
to scream like that.

899
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,103
So...

900
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:44,774
You can pick
up their scent, can't you?
Track their footprints?

901
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,568
I was with the Navy,
not the Navajo.

902
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,653
So then what should we do?
What do you suggest we do?

903
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,697
You get back.
I'll find them.

904
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:53,074
No, we'll find them.

905
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,492
You'll last two
minutes in there.

906
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:56,161
Less, in those
ridiculous shoes.

907
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,760
What is that
supposed to mean?

908
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,847
It means I'm ready to go.

909
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:18,057
Okay.

910
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:21,060
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm in charge out here.

911
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,979
You do everything I say,
exactly as I say it.

912
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,856
Excuse me?
Just relax.

913
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,694
It's just like
taking a stroll
through the woods.

914
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,531
65 million years ago.

915
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,193
Stay here.

916
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,036
Wow.

917
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,948
You still have
those matches?

918
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:43,077
Here you go.

919
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,436
Gray!

920
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,345
1992 Jeep Wrangler
Sahara, Sand Beige.

921
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,850
You remember when we fixed up
Grandpa's old Malibu, right?

922
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,436
Yeah.

923
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,322
Every time
this thing kills,
it moves further south.

924
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,949
It's headed
right for the park.

925
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,200
Why would
she come here?

926
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:06,035
She can sense
thermal radiation.

927
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,161
Our emergency measures

928
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:09,622
just put all the warm
bodies in one place.

929
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:12,500
Sir...
InGen.

930
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,461
Hoskins.

931
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:17,964
I Know who you are.

932
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,174
Then you know
why I'm here.

933
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:22,969
I've been working
for two years

934
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:24,178
on an application
for those Raptors.

935
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,850
They can hunt and
kill that creature.

936
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,227
But your program
was to test
their intelligence.

937
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,979
Yeah, it was.
And we did.

938
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,399
And in the process,
we learned something.

939
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,985
They follow orders.

940
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,154
You see, the
solution to your crisis

941
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,822
is standing right
in front of you.

942
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,325
Let me be
as clear as I can.

943
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:50,830
No Velociraptors
are going to be
set loose on this island.

944
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,081
Oh, shit.

945
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,375
You're out of your mind!

946
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,585
What are you going to do
with all these people?

947
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,503
You got 20,000 people here.
What are you going to do?

948
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,839
They have no place to go.

949
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:02,049
That thing is
a killing machine!

950
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,846
And it will not stop.

951
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,682
Okay.

952
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:11,642
I intend to personally
look into your project

953
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:16,606
to determine its viability
within the moral
principles of this company.

954
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,860
Okay, boss.

955
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,405
What's your next move?

956
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:35,458
Sir, I can't get
a hold of your instructor.

957
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,711
Never mind.
He's likely caught
up in the evacuation.

958
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,214
You're sure
there's nobody else
who can fly a helicopter?

959
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,301
We don't need anyone else.

960
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,950
You think it's out there?

961
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:19,585
I mean, I know for a fact
it is definitely not
out there, all right?

962
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,170
We're totally safe.

963
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,257
Here, go take this.

964
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,593
You're stronger than me.

965
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,189
All right. Turn it over.

966
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:44,944
Whoo!
It works!

967
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,953
I thought you failed
your driver's test.

968
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:55,872
No, only the
driving part.

969
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:15,725
This one of theirs?

970
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:16,851
Yeah.

971
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:20,646
That road goes
straight back
to the park.

972
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,984
How did they even get
one of these things started?

973
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,007
Lowery,
we found her.

974
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,591
South of the
Gyrosphere Valley,

975
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,427
between the old
park and the Aviary.

976
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,221
Wait, are you I 5
following the dinosaur'
- Yes.

977
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:20,057
Get ACU out here.
Real guns this time.

978
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:21,642
ACU is airborne.

979
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:23,811
They took the helicopter.

980
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,396
Who's flying it?

981
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:30,109
Did you boys serve
in the Armed Forces?

982
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,153
Afghanistan, sir.

983
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,740
Did your general ever fly
into battle with you?

984
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:37,783
Oh...

985
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,287
Got it! Got it.

986
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,374
We have eyes on the target,
south of the Aviary.

987
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:46,667
Proceed and engage.

988
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,961
Come on!
Look alive, boys!

989
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,172
Look alive!

990
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,682
10 o'clock!
By the birdcage!

991
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:24,455
No, no, no!

992
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,957
Looks like the fox
got in the henhouse.

993
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,393
Pull up! Pull up!
Up, up, up!

994
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:23,055
We have a breach
in the Aviary.

995
01:17:43,242 --> 01:17:45,744
Trees, the trees!
Go! Go!

996
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:12,313
Okay, that's it.

997
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,939
We're safe now.

998
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,533
Go, go!

999
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,202
Go!
Oh, shit!

1000
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:28,787
Hurry up!

1001
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,750
Hey!

1002
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:33,834
Help!

1003
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,252
Open the gate!
Let us in!

1004
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,046
Open it up!

1005
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,672
- Come on!
- Come on!

1006
01:18:38,756 --> 01:18:40,424
That's a first.

1007
01:18:40,591 --> 01:18:42,426
I
Open the gate!
Open the gate!

1008
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,761
Let us in!

1009
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:56,440
Attention Aviary
employees, there has been
a containment breach.

1010
01:18:56,523 --> 01:18:57,524
Hello?

1011
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,027
Claire, we spotted
the boys on surveillance.

1012
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:01,111
They're approaching
the west gate.

1013
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,238
I'm headed there now.

1014
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:07,159
Okay. Stay right there.
I'm on my way.
Stay right with them.

1015
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:08,827
Hey!

1016
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:10,287
Get on!

1017
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:27,221
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

1018
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,515
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

1019
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:34,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

1020
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,939
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

1021
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,361
Ladies and gentlemen,
due to a containment anomaly

1022
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,364
all guests must take
shelter immediately.

1023
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,253
All units,
take position on boardwalk.

1024
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:44,590
Use liquid tranquilizers.
Do not fire live ammunition.

1025
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:45,841
Claire, come on!

1026
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,696
Stop running!

1027
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,043
Wait.
Ah!

1028
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,669
Don't just
stand there!

1029
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:04,837
Go! Get inside now!

1030
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:22,980
Zach!

1031
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,023
Gray!

1032
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:31,363
- Aunt Claire!
- Go, go!

1033
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:32,781
Claire!

1034
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,826
No! Hold your...

1035
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,187
Is that Aunt Claire?

1036
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,667
It's them! Zach!

1037
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,128
Gray!

1038
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:30,797
Oh, my God!
Thank God! Thank God!
What happened? What is this?

1039
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,174
Are you okay?

1040
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,969
Where did you go?
Why didn't you come back?

1041
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,472
I was so worried
about you.
Who's that?

1042
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:45,771
We work together.

1043
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,065
Hey.

1044
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:50,359
We gotta go.
Okay.

1045
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:51,777
Come on, come on.

1046
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,365
Hey! You guys can't
just be walking up in...

1047
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,785
Simon Masrani's
death was a tragedy.

1048
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,790
The new mission
is to prevent
further loss of life.

1049
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:06,250
Who are these guys?

1050
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:07,793
I'm glad you asked.

1051
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,045
You're all
relieved of duty.

1052
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,090
There's a new
team on the ground.

1053
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,735
Lowery, I'm on my
way back to you.

1054
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,903
That's a bad idea.

1055
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,989
The board
assigned emergency ops

1056
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,865
to InGen's private
security division.

1057
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,034
This guy Hoskins
is in charge.

1058
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,621
And he has this insane
plan to use the Raptors
to hunt the Indominus.

1059
01:24:44,705 --> 01:24:46,665
What do you mean
"use the Raptors"?

1060
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,834
ion
Son of a bitch!

1061
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,545
You shouldn't
say "bitch."

1062
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:54,923
Take the kids.
Get them someplace safe.

1063
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:13,025
You got this!
Go faster!

1064
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:13,900
Damn it, drive!

1065
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:22,075
This does
not feel safe.

1066
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,452
Can we stay with you?

1067
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,537
lam never leaving
you as long as you live.

1068
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:26,788
No, him.

1069
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,626
Yeah, definitely him.

1070
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,238
Hey! Right here.

1071
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,866
Right here.

1072
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,868
She looks
at what she wants.

1073
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,538
Usually what
she wants to eat.

1074
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,685
The mother hen
has finally arrived.

1075
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:31,436
Oh!

1076
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:36,400
Get the hell out of here
and stay away from my animals.

1077
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,237
Hoskins, you wanted
this to happen,
you son of a bitch!

1078
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,863
Oh, Jesus!

1079
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:43,990
How many more
people have to die

1080
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,159
before this mission starts
to make sense to you?

1081
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:49,121
It's not a mission.
It's a field test.

1082
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:52,666
This is an iNGen
situation now.

1083
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,751
Okay, there are
gonna be cruise ships

1084
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,670
that show up
here at first light.

1085
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,171
Everybody's gonna
get off this island.

1086
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:02,300
You're gonna watch
a news story tomorrow
about how you all saved lives.

1087
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,635
No, better yet,

1088
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:06,221
how your animals
saved lives.

1089
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:11,685
They've never been
out of containment.
It's crazy.

1090
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,478
I
Let's move it out!

1091
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,939
This is happening!

1092
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,900
With or without you.

1093
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,906
We know that she
is in sector five.

1094
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,701
This is a game we
call hide-and-seek.
It's a scent drill.

1095
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,620
We've done it
about a thousand times
with these animals.

1096
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:34,166
When they get on target,
and they will get on target,

1097
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,334
wait to engage.

1098
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,920
Velociraptors
are pack hunters.

1099
01:27:39,004 --> 01:27:41,631
They like to herd
the animal into a kill zone.

1100
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:42,966
That's when we take our shot.

1101
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:44,843
Get a clear shot,
wait on my command,

1102
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,553
and give her
everything you got.

1103
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:50,807
We got one good
target, gentlemen.
Do not shoot my Raptors.

1104
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:53,185
Please.

1105
01:27:53,727 --> 01:27:55,562
Easy, Blue.

1106
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,106
Easy.

1107
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:00,734
Attagirl.

1108
01:28:03,445 --> 01:28:05,322
You don't scare me.

1109
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:06,698
Owen.

1110
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:11,953
Are they safe?

1111
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:14,915
No, they're not.

1112
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,751
What are their names?

1113
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,252
Well, you got Charlie.

1114
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,047
There's Echo.
Here is Delta.

1115
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,717
This one's called Blue.
She's the beta.

1116
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:27,719
Who's the alpha?

1117
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,429
You're looking at him, kid.

1118
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,353
See?

1119
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:37,896
Totally safe.

1120
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:40,899
All right, get in. Come on.

1121
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,317
Get in there.

1122
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,572
If you need me,
I'll be right up front.

1123
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:48,949
Just open that window.

1124
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:50,992
Okay?

1125
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,786
Put your seatbelts on.

1126
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,042
Okay, so just...

1127
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,503
Hold hands.

1128
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:20,272
Um...

1129
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:23,108
Nothing's getting
in here, right?

1130
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:27,362
Hey.

1131
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,575
Do you remember that
ghost at the old house?

1132
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:33,451
Remember, the one
in the garage?

1133
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,330
I protected you, right?

1134
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,627
You made a battle
axe out of a ruler
and a paper plate.

1135
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:44,963
Yeah.

1136
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,883
See, nothing is gonna get you
while I'm around, okay?

1137
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,219
But you're not
always gonna be around.

1138
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,889
Yeah, well...

1139
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:55,974
Hey...

1140
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,144
We're brothers, okay?

1141
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:02,981
We'll always be brothers,
and we'll always come
back to one another.

1142
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,526
No matter what.

1143
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:08,862
No matter what?

1144
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:10,989
No matter what.

1145
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:34,846
Awesome.

1146
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:48,985
Here we go.

1147
01:32:00,557 --> 01:32:02,392
Your boyfriend's a badass.

1148
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:18,491
Imagine if we
had these puppies
in Tora Bora.

1149
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:21,995
Are you recording
this thing?

1150
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:36,134
They're slowing down.

1151
01:32:37,469 --> 01:32:38,803
They got something.

1152
01:32:57,572 --> 01:32:58,615
You know what?
No, no, no.

1153
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,158
You guys are not
gonna watch this.

1154
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,493
Keep the window closed.

1155
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,364
Something's wrong.

1156
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,616
They're communicating.

1157
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:52,293
I Know why they
wouldn't tell us
what it's made of.

1158
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,378
Why?

1159
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:00,301
That
thing's part Raptor.

1160
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,894
What's taking
them so long?
Light it up!

1161
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:11,312
Engage!

1162
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,412
Oh, my God.

1163
01:34:38,715 --> 01:34:40,049
Watch your six.

1164
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:42,552
Raptors got a new alpha.

1165
01:36:04,092 --> 01:36:06,386
To the vehicles now!

1166
01:36:06,511 --> 01:36:08,596
Fall back!

1167
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,199
No!

1168
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:32,078
No! Blue!

1169
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:47,552
Oh, my God.

1170
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:50,221
Is everybody dead?

1171
01:36:50,388 --> 01:36:52,140
No, no, no.
Everyone is fine.

1172
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,516
Don't lie to him.

1173
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,019
He's scared.
It's okay to lie
when people are scared.

1174
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:58,104
I wanna go home.

1175
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:00,606
Sweetheart, you will,
okay? I promise.

1176
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,608
Tomorrow you will be home,

1177
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,486
and your mother will
never let me see you again.

1178
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:07,405
I I
Get out of here! Go!

1179
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:14,037
They're coming!

1180
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,257
Just hold on back there.

1181
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,641
Turn it on.
I don't Know how.

1182
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:24,982
Now!

1183
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,823
Are you boys okay?

1184
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,574
Did you see that?

1185
01:38:33,658 --> 01:38:35,451
I can't wait to tell Mom.

1186
01:38:35,535 --> 01:38:38,663
Please, no.
Do not tell your
mother about that, ever.

1187
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:43,167
Owen!
Owen!

1188
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:50,967
We gotta get indoors.
Follow me.

1189
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,392
Lowery, we're headed your way.
Call in a chopper.

1190
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:15,032
Everything must
be accounted for.

1191
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:17,285
I want all backup
generators online.

1192
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:24,500
Where have you been?

1193
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,879
Change of plans.
Mission took
a jog to the left.

1194
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:29,213
I'm taking
everything off-site.

1195
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,715
The embryos are safe here.

1196
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,176
They can live
up to eight weeks
on the generators.

1197
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:36,846
No, no. You listen.
The park's gonna be
Chapter 11 by morning.

1198
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,598
Okay? Our
little side project's

1199
01:39:38,681 --> 01:39:39,682
about to get
a shot in the arm.

1200
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:40,808
I don't want
a bunch of lawyers

1201
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:43,478
messing around with something
that they don't understand.

1202
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:44,729
You get it?

1203
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,481
Hey?

1204
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,566
I'm gonna take
that as a yes.

1205
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,738
Ladies and
gentlemen, we'd like to thank
you for your patience.

1206
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:57,450
The next ferry will be
leaving in 45 minutes.

1207
01:39:57,617 --> 01:40:00,495
If you require
immediate medical attention,

1208
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,914
please report to
the nearest
health service station.

1209
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,248
Is this what
you had in mind?

1210
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:07,543
Okay, people.
We have an extraction
point at the east dock.

1211
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:11,714
Hey.

1212
01:40:11,797 --> 01:40:14,133
They said we
had to evacuate.
There's a boat.

1213
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,219
You coming?

1214
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:25,853
Someone has
to stay behind.

1215
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:32,568
Oh, no.
I have a boyfriend.

1216
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:36,531
I didn't know
that you guys were,
like, together-together.

1217
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:37,698
We are.

1218
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:40,284
That's good.
You don't mention
him, ever.

1219
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:41,536
No, I'm at work.

1220
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,079
No, no, no. Yeah.

1221
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,207
Well...
Yeah, okay.

1222
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:47,291
Great.
Great.

1223
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:48,376
Okay.
Okay.

1224
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,669
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah.

1225
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,004
Okay, bye.

1226
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:02,223
Where's Hoskins?

1227
01:41:02,306 --> 01:41:04,642
He's sending you
and the assets to
a secure location.

1228
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:07,019
But our deal
is still intact?

1229
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:10,022
Don't worry.
You'll be well taken
care of. Let's go!

1230
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,282
Thank you for
visiting Jurassic World.

1231
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:21,576
We hope you
enjoyed your adventure.

1232
01:41:21,659 --> 01:41:24,287
Don't forget to
visit the gift shop,
and remember...

1233
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:27,832
It's always happy
hour at Margaritaville.

1234
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,796
Come on, come on.
Go inside.

1235
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:42,972
Control room.
That way.

1236
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:55,610
They evacuated the lab.

1237
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:37,568
What are you doing?

1238
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:40,988
I'm afraid that's
above your pay
grade, honey.

1239
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,115
Where's Henry?

1240
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,910
Dr. Wu,
he works for us.

1241
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:48,704
That's not
a real dinosaur.

1242
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:52,291
No, it ain't, kid.

1243
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:56,712
But somebody's gotta
make sure that this
company has a future.

1244
01:42:57,421 --> 01:42:58,506
Imagine,

1245
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:02,843
that one,
a fraction of the size,

1246
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:05,346
deadly, intelligent,

1247
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:09,266
able to hide from
the most advanced
military technology.

1248
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:12,853
A living weapon
unlike anything
we've ever seen.

1249
01:43:12,937 --> 01:43:13,896
You see...

1250
01:43:13,979 --> 01:43:18,025
Millions of
years of evolution,
what did we learn?

1251
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:22,571
Nature is the
gift that just...

1252
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:24,115
Oh, shit!

1253
01:43:27,326 --> 01:43:28,619
Easy.

1254
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:31,539
Easy, boy.

1255
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,874
Easy. Hey, hey.

1256
01:43:36,127 --> 01:43:39,964
We're on the same side,
right? Right?

1257
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:43,384
Easy.

1258
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,468
Easy.

1259
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:47,763
I'm on your side.

1260
01:43:56,856 --> 01:43:58,232
No, boys.
Boys, this way.
Come on.

1261
01:43:58,315 --> 01:43:59,650
Come on. Come on.

1262
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,021
That's how it is?

1263
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:55,372
Easy. Easy.

1264
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:00,711
Easy.

1265
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:12,389
That's it.

1266
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:23,961
24, 50.

1267
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:26,005
We need more.

1268
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,966
More what?

1269
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:30,092
Teeth.

1270
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:31,719
We need more teeth.

1271
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,148
Okay, so you
just wait here.

1272
01:46:45,566 --> 01:46:46,609
It's gonna be fine.

1273
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:36,742
Lowery, are you still there?

1274
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:38,535
Hey, where are you?

1275
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,579
I need you to open Paddock 9.

1276
01:47:41,372 --> 01:47:42,539
Paddock 9?

1277
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,250
You kidding?

1278
01:47:50,506 --> 01:47:53,592
Damn it, Lowery, be a man
and do something
for once in your life.

1279
01:47:53,676 --> 01:47:55,803
Why do you have to
make it personal?

1280
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:11,814
Run!

1281
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:14,108
Go! Go, go!

1282
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:45,193
Oh, my God,
it's your parents.
It's your parents.

1283
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:48,280
Come on,
come on.

1284
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,703
Are you okay?
Oh, baby.

1285
01:54:03,754 --> 01:54:05,589
I'm so sorry.

1286
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:09,092
Are you okay?

1287
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,681
Come here.

1288
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:17,893
Sweetie.

1289
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:36,661
So, what do we do now?

1290
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,165
Probably stick together.

1291
01:54:42,084 --> 01:54:43,502
For survival.
