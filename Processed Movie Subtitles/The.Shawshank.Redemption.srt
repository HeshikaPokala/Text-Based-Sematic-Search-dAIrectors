I was just wondering

I haven't made up my mind.

I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

206
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,623
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

207
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,251
- A what?
- A rock hammer.

208

- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

209
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,341
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

210
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,969
But then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

211
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,972
Fair enough.

212
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,017
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

213
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,561
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

214
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,980
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

216
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,402

You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

That's the other thing. He never shut up.

...I say to him,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

922
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:12,676
So he says:

923
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:16,805
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

924

rich pricks that come in.

know what a state he put you in.

Well, let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

I can get a new trial.

That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1038
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,551
No more protection from the guards.

1039
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,639
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1040
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:42,477
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1041
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,396
And the library?

1042
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:47,064
Gone.

1043
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:50,234
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1044
01:39:50,693 --> 01:39:53,362
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1045
01:39:53,571 --> 01:39:55,698
They'll see the flames for miles.

1046
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:58,743
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1047
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,997
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1048
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,586
Or am I being obtuse?

1049
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:23,017
Give him another month
to think about it.

1050
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,817
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1051
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,486
Like a closed book.

1052
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,322
Complained about it all the time.

1053
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:20,825
She was beautiful.

1054
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:25,037
God, I loved her.

1055
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:30,668
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1056
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,089
I killed her, Red.

1057
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,759
I didn't pull the trigger...

1058
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:41,929
...but I drove her away.

1059
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:46,142
That's why she died, because of me...

1060
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:47,685
...the way I am.

1061
01:41:56,694 --> 01:41:58,529
That don't make you a murderer.

1062
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:03,701
Bad husband, maybe.

1063
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,583
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1064
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,126
No, I didn't.

1065
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,462
Somebody else did.

1066
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,798
And I wound up in here.

1067
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,886
Bad luck, I guess.

1068
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:28,517
- Yeah.
- It floats around.

1069
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,771
It's got to land on somebody.

1070
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:34,565
It was my turn, that's all.

1071
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:38,069
I was in the path of the tornado.

1072
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:47,953
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1073
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,001
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1074
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,671
Me?

1075
01:42:59,256 --> 01:43:00,591
Yeah.

1076
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,886
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1077
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,182
...and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1078
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,935
I tell you where I'd go.

1079
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,105
Zihuatanejo.

1080
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,107
Say what?

1081
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,275
Zihuatanejo.

1082
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,861
It's in Mexico.

1083
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,365
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1084
01:43:25,491 --> 01:43:28,285
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1085
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:32,123
- No.
- They say it has no memory.

1086
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:36,752
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1087
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:40,881
A warm place with no memory.

1088
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,053
Open up a little hotel...

1089
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:49,265
...right on the beach.

1090
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:52,059
Buy some worthless old boat...

1091
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,228
...and fix it up new.

1092
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:58,190
Take my guests out...

1093
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:00,401
...charter fishing.

1094
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,990
Zihuatanejo.

1095
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:13,372
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1096
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,757
I don't think I could make it
on the outside, Andy.

1097
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:31,515
I been in here most of my life.

1098
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:34,685
I'm an institutional man now.

1099
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,354
Just like Brooks was.

1100
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:40,524
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1101
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:42,693
I don't think so.

1102
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:50,451
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1103
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,746
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1104
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:56,207
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1105

1106
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:01,587

1109
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:09,637
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1110
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,600
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1111
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,144
That hotel, that boat...

1112
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:21,148
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1113
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,489
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1114
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,741
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1115
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,619

1116

Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1118
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,461
It's down there and I'm in here.

1119
01:45:45,047 --> 01:45:47,758
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1121
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,599

Sure, Andy. Anything.

1126
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,622
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1127
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:23,252
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1128
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:27,381
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1129
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,467
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1130
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:33,888
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1131
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,391
We went there for a picnic...

1132
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,894
...and made love under that oak...

1133
01:46:40,561 --> 01:46:42,813
...and I asked and she said yes.

1134
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,652
Promise me, Red.

1135
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,113

1136
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,823
...find that spot.

1137
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:58,829
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1138
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:03,000
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1139
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:08,339
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1140
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,341
What, Andy?

1141
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,509
What's buried under there?

1142
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,971
You'll have to pry it up...

1143
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,431
...to see.

1144
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,272
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1145
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,691
He's talking funny.

1146
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,486
I'm really worried about him.

01:47:32,529 --> 01:47:35,783

but at night he's all alone.

Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1152
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,086
He asked me for a length of rope.

1153
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:50,005
- Rope?
- Six feet long.

1154
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,590
And you gave it to him.

1155
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:54,259
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1156
01:47:54,468 --> 01:47:56,053

1159
01:48:00,599 --> 01:48:04,311
No. Andy would never do that.

01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:06,355
Never.
